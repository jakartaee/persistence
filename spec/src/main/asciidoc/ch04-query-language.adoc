== Query Language [[a4665]]

The Jakarta Persistence query language is a
string-based query language used to define queries over entities and
their persistent state. It enables the application developer to specify
the semantics of queries in a portable way, independent of the
particular database schema in use in an enterprise environment. The full
range of the language may be used in both static and dynamic queries.

This chapter provides the full definition of
the Jakarta Persistence query language.

=== Overview

The Jakarta Persistence query language is a
query specification language for string-based dynamic queries and static
queries expressed through metadata. It is used to define queries over
the persistent entities defined by this specification and their
persistent state and relationships.

The Jakarta Persistence query language can be
compiled to a target language, such as SQL, of a database or other
persistent store. This allows the execution of queries to be shifted to
the native language facilities provided by the database, instead of
requiring queries to be executed on the runtime representation of the
entity state. As a result, query methods can be optimizable as well as
portable.

The query language uses the abstract
persistence schema of entities, including their embedded objects and
relationships, for its data model, and it defines operators and
expressions based on this data model. It uses a SQL-like syntax to
select objects or values based on abstract schema types and
relationships. It is possible to parse and validate queries before
entities are deployed.

[NOTE]
====
The term abstract persistence schema refers
to the persistent schema abstraction (persistent entities, their state,
and their relationships) over which Jakarta Persistence queries operate.
Queries over this persistent schema abstraction are translated into
queries that are executed over the database schema to which entities are
mapped.
====

Queries may be defined in metadata
annotations or the XML descriptor. The abstract schema types of a set of
entities can be used in a query if the entities are defined in the same
persistence unit as the query. Path expressions allow for navigation
over relationships defined in the persistence unit.

[NOTE]
====
A persistence unit defines the set of all
classes that are related or grouped by the application and which must be
colocated in their mapping to a single database.
====

=== Statement Types

A Jakarta Persistence query language statement
may be either a select statement, an update statement, or a delete
statement.

[NOTE]
====
This chapter refers to all such statements as
“queries”. Where it is important to distinguish among statement types,
the specific statement type is referenced.
====

In BNF syntax, a query language statement is
defined as:

----
QL_statement :: = select_statement | update_statement | delete_statement
----

Any Jakarta Persistence query language statement
may be constructed dynamically or may be statically defined in a
metadata annotation or XML descriptor element.

All statement types may have parameters.

==== Select Statements

A select statement is a string which consists
of the following clauses:

* a SELECT clause, which determines the type of
the objects or values to be selected.
* a FROM clause, which provides declarations
that designate the domain to which the expressions specified in the
other clauses of the query apply.
* an optional WHERE clause, which may be used
to restrict the results that are returned by the query.
* an optional GROUP BY clause, which allows
query results to be aggregated in terms of groups.
* an optional HAVING clause, which allows
filtering over aggregated groups.
* an optional ORDER BY clause, which may be
used to order the results that are returned by the query.

In BNF syntax, a select statement is defined
as:

----
select_statement :: = select_clause from_clause [where_clause] [groupby_clause] [having_clause] [orderby_clause]
----

A select statement must always have a SELECT
and a FROM clause. The square brackets [] indicate that the other
clauses are optional.

==== Update and Delete Statements

Update and delete statements provide bulk
operations over sets of entities.

In BNF syntax, these operations are defined
as:

----
update_statement :: = update_clause [where_clause]
delete_statement :: = delete_clause [where_clause]
----

The update and delete clauses determine the
type of the entities to be updated or deleted. The WHERE clause may be
used to restrict the scope of the update or delete operation.

Update and delete statements are described
further in <<a5636>>.

=== Abstract Schema Types and Query Domains

The Jakarta Persistence query language is a
typed language, and every expression has a type. The type of an
expression is derived from the structure of the expression, the abstract
schema types of the identification variable declarations, the types to
which the persistent attributes evaluate, and the types of literals.

The abstract schema type of an entity or
embeddable is derived from its class and the metadata information
provided by Java language annotations or in the XML descriptor.

Informally, the abstract schema type of an
entity or embeddable can be characterized as follows:

* For every non-relationship persistent field
or get accessor method (for a persistent property) of the class, there
is a field (“state field”) whose abstract schema type corresponds to
that of the field or the result type of the accessor method.
* For every persistent relationship field or
get accessor method (for a persistent relationship property) of the
class, there is a field (“association field”) whose type is the abstract
schema type of the related entity (or, if the relationship is a
one-to-many or many-to-many, a collection of such).

Abstract schema types are specific to the
query language data model. The persistence provider is not required to
implement or otherwise materialize an abstract schema type.

The domain of a query consists of the
abstract schema types of all entities and embeddables that are defined
in the same persistence unit.

The domain of a query may be restricted by
the _navigability_ of the relationships of the entity and associated
embeddable classes on which it is based. The association fields of an
entity's or embeddable's abstract schema type determine navigability.
Using the association fields and their values, a query can select
related entities and use their abstract schema types in the query.

==== Naming

Entities are designated in query strings by
their entity names. The entity name is defined by the _name_ element of
the _Entity_ annotation (or the _entity-name_ XML descriptor element),
and defaults to the unqualified name of the entity class. Entity names
are scoped within the persistence unit and must be unique within the
persistence unit.

==== Example [[a4713]]

This example assumes that the application
developer provides several entity classes, representing orders,
products, and line items, and an embeddable address class representing
shipping addresses and billing addresses. The abstract schema types for
the entities are _Order_, _Product_, and _LineItem_ respectively.
There is a one-to-many relationship between _Order_ and _LineItem_. The
entity _LineItem_ is related to _Product_ in a many-to-one relationship.
The classes are logically in the same persistence unit, as shown in
<<a4724>>.

Queries to select orders can be defined by
navigating over the association fields and state fields defined by
_Order_ and _LineItem_. A query to find all orders with pending line
items might be written as follows:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT o
FROM Order AS o JOIN o.lineItems AS l
WHERE l.shipped = FALSE
----

.Abstract Persistence Schema of Several Entities with Defined in the Same Persistence Unit.
[[a4724]]
image::images/Per-6.png[Image]

This query navigates over the association
field _lineItems_ of the abstract schema type _Order_ to find line
items, and uses the state field _shipped_ of _LineItem_ to select those
orders that have at least one line item that has not yet shipped. (Note
that this query does not select orders that have no line items.)

Although reserved identifiers, such as
DISTINCT, FROM, AS, JOIN, WHERE, and FALSE appear in upper case in this
example, reserved identifiers are case
insensitive.footnote:[This chapter uses the
convention that reserved identifiers appear in upper case in the
examples and BNF for the language.]

The SELECT clause of this example designates
the return type of this query to be of type Order.

Because the same persistence unit defines the
abstract persistence schema of the related entities, the developer can
also specify a query over orders that utilizes the abstract schema type
for products, and hence the state fields and association fields of both
the abstract schema types _Order_ and _Product_. For example, if the
abstract schema type _Product_ has a state field named _productType_, a
query over orders can be specified using this state field. Such a query
might be to find all orders for products with product type office
supplies. A query for this might be as follows.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT o
FROM Order o JOIN o.lineItems l JOIN l.product p
WHERE p.productType = 'office_supplies'
----

Because _Order_ is related to _Product_ by
means of the relationships between _Order_ and _LineItem_ and between
_LineItem_ and _Product_, navigation using the association fields
_lineItems_ and _product_ is used to express the query. This query is
specified by using the entity name _Order_, which designates the
abstract schema type over which the query ranges. The basis for the
navigation is provided by the association fields _lineItems_ and
_product_ of the abstract schema types Order and LineItem respectively.

=== The FROM Clause and Navigational Declarations

The FROM clause of a query defines the domain
of the query by declaring identification
variables. An identification variable is an identifier declared in the
FROM clause of a query. The domain of the
query may be constrained by path expressions. (See <<a4792>>.)

Identification variables designate instances
of a particular abstract schema type. The FROM clause can contain
multiple identification variable declarations separated by a comma (_,_
).

----
from_clause ::=
    FROM identification_variable_declaration
        {, {identification_variable_declaration | collection_member_declaration}}*

identification_variable_declaration ::= range_variable_declaration {join | fetch_join}*

range_variable_declaration ::= entity_name [AS] identification_variable

join ::= join_spec join_association_path_expression [AS] identification_variable [join_condition]

fetch_join ::= join_spec FETCH join_association_path_expression

join_association_path_expression ::=
    join_collection_valued_path_expression |
    join_single_valued_path_expression |
    TREAT(join_collection_valued_path_expression AS subtype) |
    TREAT(join_single_valued_path_expression AS subtype)

join_collection_valued_path_expression ::= identification_variable.{single_valued_embeddable_object_field.}*collection_valued_field

join_single_valued_path_expression ::= identification_variable.{single_valued_embeddable_object_field.}*single_valued_object_field

join_spec ::= [LEFT [OUTER] | INNER] JOIN

join_condition ::= ON conditional_expression

collection_member_declaration ::= IN (collection_valued_path_expression) [AS] identification_variable
----

The following subsections discuss the constructs used in the FROM clause.

==== Identifiers [[a4760]]

An identifier is a character sequence of
unlimited length. The character sequence must begin with a Java
identifier start character, and all other characters must be Java
identifier part characters. An identifier start character is any
character for which the method _Character.isJavaIdentifierStart_ returns
true. This includes the underscore (___) character and the dollar sign
(_$_) character. An identifier part character is any character for
which the method _Character.isJavaIdentifierPart_ returns true. The
question mark (_?_) character is reserved for use by the Jakarta
Persistence query language.

The following are reserved identifiers: ABS,
ALL, AND, ANY, AS, ASC, AVG, BETWEEN, BIT_LENGTHfootnote:[BIT_LENGTH,
CHAR_LENGTH, CHARACTER_LENGTH, POSITION, and UNKNOWN are not currently
used: they are reserved for future use.],
BOTH, BY, CASE, CHAR_LENGTH, CHARACTER_LENGTH, CLASS, COALESCE, CONCAT,
COUNT, CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, DELETE, DESC,
DISTINCT, ELSE, EMPTY, END, ENTRY, ESCAPE, EXISTS, FALSE, FETCH, FROM,
FUNCTION, GROUP, HAVING, IN, INDEX, INNER, IS, JOIN, KEY, LEADING, LEFT,
LENGTH, LIKE, LOCATE, LOWER, MAX, MEMBER, MIN, MOD, NEW, NOT, NULL,
NULLIF, OBJECT, OF, ON, OR, ORDER, OUTER, POSITION, SELECT, SET, SIZE,
SOME, SQRT, SUBSTRING, SUM, THEN, TRAILING, TREAT, TRIM, TRUE, TYPE,
UNKNOWN, UPDATE, UPPER, VALUE, WHEN, WHERE.

Reserved identifiers are case insensitive.
Reserved identifiers must not be used as identification variables or
result variables (see <<a5438>>).

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended that SQL key words other
than those listed above not be used as identification variables in
queries because they may be used as reserved identifiers in future
releases of this specification.
====

==== Identification Variables [[a4765]]

An identification
variable is a valid identifier declared in the FROM clause of a query.

All identification variables must be declared
in the FROM clause. Identification variables cannot be declared in other
clauses.

An identification variable must not be a
reserved identifier or have the same name as any entity in the same
persistence unit.

Identification variables are case
insensitive.

An identification variable evaluates to a
value of the type of the expression used in declaring the variable. For
example, consider the previous query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT o
FROM Order o JOIN o.lineItems l JOIN l.product p
WHERE p.productType = 'office_supplies'
----

In the FROM clause declaration _o.lineItems_
_l_, the identification variable _l_ evaluates to any LineItem value
directly reachable from Order. The association field _lineItems_ is a
collection of instances of the abstract schema type LineItem and the
identification variable _l_ refers to an element of this collection. The
type of _l_ is the abstract schema type of _LineItem_.

An identification variable can range over an
entity, embeddable, or basic abstract schema type. An identification
variable designates an instance of an abstract schema type or an element
of a collection of abstract schema type instances.

Note that for identification variables
referring to an instance of an association or collection represented as
a _java.util.Map_, the identification variable is of the abstract
schema type of the map _value_.

An identification variable always designates
a reference to a single value. It is declared in one of three ways: in a
range variable declaration, in a join clause, or in a collection member
declaration. The identification variable declarations are evaluated from
left to right in the FROM clause, and an identification variable
declaration can use the result of a preceding identification variable
declaration of the query string.

All identification variables used in the
SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, or HAVING clause of a SELECT or
DELETE statement must be declared in the FROM clause. The identification
variables used in the WHERE clause of an UPDATE statement must be
declared in the UPDATE clause.

Identification variables are existentially
quantified in these clauses. This means that an identification variable
represents a member of a collection or an instance of an entity's
abstract schema type. An identification variable never designates a
collection in its entirety.

An identification variable is scoped to the
query (or subquery) in which it is defined and is also visible to any
subqueries within that query scope that do not define an identification
variable of the same name.

==== Range Variable Declarations

The syntax for declaring an
identification variable as a range variable is similar to that of SQL;
optionally, it uses the AS keyword. A range variable designates an
entity abstract schema type.footnote:[A range variable must
not designate an embeddable class abstract schema type.]

----
range_variable_declaration ::= entity_name [AS] identification_variable
----

Range variable declarations allow the
developer to designate a “root” for objects which may not be reachable
by navigation.

In order to select values by comparing more
than one instance of an entity abstract schema type, more than one
identification variable ranging over the abstract schema type is needed
in the FROM clause.

The following query returns orders whose
quantity is greater than the order quantity for John Smith. This example
illustrates the use of two different identification variables in the
FROM clause, both of the abstract schema type Order. The SELECT clause
of this query determines that it is the orders with quantities larger
than John Smith's that are returned.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT o1
FROM Order o1, Order o2
WHERE o1.quantity > o2.quantity AND
 o2.customer.lastname = 'Smith' AND
 o2.customer.firstname= 'John'
----

==== Path Expressions[[a4792]]

An identification variable followed by the
navigation operator (_._) and a state field or association field is a
path expression. The type of the path expression is the type computed as
the result of navigation; that is, the type of the state field or
association field to which the expression navigates. The type of a path
expression that navigates to an association field may be specified as a
subtype of the declared type of the association field by means of the
TREAT operator. See <<a4965>>.

An identification variable qualified
by the KEY, VALUE, or ENTRY operator is a path expression. The KEY,
VALUE, and ENTRY operators may only be applied to identification
variables that correspond to map-valued associations or map-valued
element collections. The type of the path expression is the type
computed as the result of the operation; that is, the abstract schema
type of the field that is the value of the KEY, VALUE, or ENTRY operator
(the map key, map value, or map entry
respectively).footnote:[Note that use of
VALUE is optional, as an identification variable referring to an
association of type _java.util.Map_ is of the abstract schema type of
the map value. (See <<a4765>>.)]

In the following query, photos is a map from photo label to filename.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT i.name, VALUE(p)
FROM Item i JOIN i.photos p
WHERE KEY(p) LIKE '%egret'
----

In the above query the identification
variable _p_ designates an abstract schema type corresponding to the map
_value_. The results of _VALUE(p)_ and _KEY(p)_ are the map value and
the map key associated with _p_, respectively. The following query is
equivalent:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT i.name, p
FROM Item i JOIN i.photos p
WHERE KEY(p) LIKE '%egret'
----

A path expression using the KEY or VALUE
operator can be further composed. A path expression using the ENTRY
operator is terminal. It cannot be further composed and can only appear
in the SELECT list of a query.

The syntax for qualified identification variables is as follows.

----
qualified_identification_variable ::=
    map_field_identification_variable |
    ENTRY(identification_variable)

map_field_identification_variable ::=
    KEY(identification_variable) |
    VALUE(identification_variable)
----

Depending on navigability, a path expression
that leads to an association field or to a field whose type is an
embeddable class may be further composed. Path expressions can be
composed from other path expressions if the original path expression
evaluates to a single-valued type (not a collection).

In the following example, _contactInfo_
denotes an embeddable class consisting of an address and set of phones.
_Phone_ is an entity.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT p.vendor
FROM Employee e JOIN e.contactInfo.phones p
WHERE e.contactInfo.address.zipcode = '95054'
----

Path expression navigability is composed
using “inner join” semantics. That is, if the value of a non-terminal
field in the path expression is null, the path is considered to have no
value, and does not participate in the determination of the result.

The following query is equivalent to the
query above:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT p.vendor
FROM Employee e JOIN e.contactInfo c JOIN c.phones p
WHERE e.contactInfo.address.zipcode = '95054'
----

===== Path Expression Syntax

The syntax for single-valued path expressions
and collection-valued path expressions is as follows.

An identification variable used in a
_single_valued_object_path_expression_ or in a
_collection_valued_path_expression_ may be an unqualified identification
variable or an identification variable to which the KEY or VALUE
function has been applied.

----
general_identification_variable ::=
    identification_variable |
    map_field_identification_variable
----

The type of an entity-valued path expression
or an entity-valued subpath of a path expression used in a WHERE clause
may be specified as a subtype of the corresponding declared type by
means of the TREAT operator. See <<a4965>>.

----
general_subpath ::= simple_subpath | treated_subpath{.single_valued_object_field}*

simple_subpath ::=
    general_identification_variable |
    general_identification_variable{.single_valued_object_field}*

treated_subpath ::= TREAT(general_subpath AS subtype)

single_valued_path_expression ::=
    qualified_identification_variable |
    TREAT(qualified_identification_variable AS subtype) |
    state_field_path_expression |
    single_valued_object_path_expression

state_field_path_expression ::= general_subpath.state_field

state_valued_path_expression ::= state_field_path_expression | general_identification_variable

single_valued_object_path_expression ::= general_subpath.single_valued_object_field

collection_valued_path_expression ::= general_subpath.collection_valued_field
----

A _single_valued_object_field_ is designated by the name of an association
field in a one-to-one or many-to-one relationship or a field of
embeddable class type. The type of a _single_valued_object_field_
is the abstract schema type of the related
entity or embeddable class.

A _state _field_ is designated by the name of
an entity or embeddable class state field that corresponds to a basic
type.

A _collection_valued_field_ is designated by the name of an association
field in a one-to-many or a many-to-many relationship or by the name of
an element collection field. The type of a _collection_valued_field_ is
a collection of values of the abstract schema type of the related entity
or element type.

It is syntactically illegal to compose a path
expression from a path expression that evaluates to a collection. For
example, if o designates Order, the path expression o.lineItems.product
is illegal since navigation to _lineItems_ results in a collection. This
case should produce an error when the query string is verified. To
handle such a navigation, an identification variable must be declared in
the FROM clause to range over the elements of the _lineItems_
collection. Another path expression must be used to navigate over each
such element in the WHERE clause of the query, as in the following:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT l.product
FROM Order AS o JOIN o.lineItems l
----

It is illegal to use a
_collection_valued_path_expression_ other than in the FROM clause of a
query except in an _empty_collection_comparison_expression,_ in a
_collection_member_expression_, or as an argument to the SIZE operator.
See <<a5139>>, <<a5150>>, and <<a5284>>.

==== Joins

An inner join may be implicitly specified by
the use of a cartesian product in the FROM clause and a join condition
in the WHERE clause. In the absence of a join condition, this reduces to
the cartesian product.

The main use case for this generalized style
of join is when a join condition does not involve a foreign key
relationship that is mapped to an entity relationship.

Example:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c FROM Customer c, Employee e WHERE c.hatsize = e.shoesize
----

In general, use of this style of inner join
(also referred to as theta-join) is less typical than explicitly defined
joins over relationships.

The syntax for explicit join operations is as
follows:

----
join ::= join_spec join_association_path_expression [AS] identification_variable [join_condition]

fetch_join ::= join_spec FETCH join_association_path_expression

join_association_path_expression ::=
    join_collection_valued_path_expression |
    join_single_valued_path_expression |
    TREAT(join_collection_valued_path_expression _AS_ subtype) |
    TREAT(join_single_valued_path_expression AS subtype)

join_collection_valued_path_expression ::=
    identification_variable.{single_valued_embeddable_object_field.}*collection_valued_field

join_single_valued_path_expression ::=
    identification_variable.{single_valued_embeddable_object_field.}*single_valued_object_field

join_spec ::= [LEFT [OUTER] | INNER] JOIN

join_condition ::= ON conditional_expression
----

The inner and outer join operation types
described in <<a4884>>, <<a4898>>, and <<a4931>> are supported.

===== Inner Joins (Relationship Joins) [[a4884]]

The syntax for the inner join operation is

----
[INNER] JOIN join_association_path_expression [AS] identification_variable [join_condition]
----

For example, the query below joins over the
relationship between customers and orders. This type of join typically
equates to a join over a foreign key relationship in the database.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c FROM Customer c JOIN c.orders o WHERE c.status = 1
----

The keyword INNER may optionally be used:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c FROM Customer c INNER JOIN c.orders o WHERE c.status = 1
----

This is equivalent to the following query
using the earlier IN construct, defined in
<<a19497>>. It selects those customers of
status 1 for which at least one order exists:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT OBJECT(c) FROM Customer c, IN(c.orders) o WHERE c.status = 1
----

The query below joins over _Employee_,
_ContactInfo_ and _Phone_. _ContactInfo_ is an embeddable class that
consists of an address and set of phones. _Phone_ is an entity.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT p.vendor
FROM Employee e JOIN e.contactInfo c JOIN c.phones p
WHERE c.address.zipcode = '95054'
----

A join condition may be specified for an
inner join. This is equivalent to specification of the same condition in
the WHERE clause.

===== Left Outer Joins [[a4898]]

LEFT JOIN and LEFT OUTER JOIN are synonymous.
They enable the retrieval of a set of entities where matching values in
the join condition may be absent.

The syntax for a left outer join is

----
LEFT [OUTER] JOIN join_association_path_expression [AS] identification_variable [join_condition]
----

An outer join without a specified join
condition has an implicit join condition over the foreign key
relationship corresponding to the join_association_path_expression. It
would typically be mapped to a SQL outer join with an ON condition on
the foreign key relationship as in the queries below:

Jakarta Persistence query language:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT s.name, COUNT(p)
FROM Suppliers s LEFT JOIN s.products p
GROUP BY s.name
----

SQL:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT s.name, COUNT(p.id)
FROM Suppliers s LEFT JOIN Products p
    ON s.id = p.supplierId
GROUP By s.name
----

An outer join with an explicit ON condition
would cause an additional specified join condition to be added to the
generated SQL:

Jakarta Persistence query language:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT s.name, COUNT(p)
FROM Suppliers s LEFT JOIN s.products p
    ON p.status = 'inStock'
GROUP BY s.name
----

SQL:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT s.name, COUNT(p.id)
FROM Suppliers s LEFT JOIN Products p
    ON s.id = p.supplierId AND p.status = 'inStock'
GROUP BY s.name
----

Note that the result of this query will be
different from that of the following query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT s.name, COUNT(p)
FROM Suppliers s LEFT JOIN s.products p
WHERE p.status = 'inStock'
GROUP BY s.name
----

The result of the latter query will exclude
suppliers who have no products in stock whereas the former query will
include them.

An important use case for LEFT JOIN is in
enabling the prefetching of related data items as a side effect of a
query. This is accomplished by specifying the LEFT JOIN as a FETCH JOIN
as described below.

===== Fetch Joins [[a4931]]

A FETCH JOIN enables the fetching of an
association or element collection as a side effect of the execution of a
query.

The syntax for a fetch join is

----
fetch_join ::= [LEFT [OUTER] | INNER] JOIN FETCH join_association_path_expression
----

The association referenced by the right side
of the FETCH JOIN clause must be an association or element collection
that is referenced from an entity or embeddable that is returned as a
result of the query. It is not permitted to specify an identification
variable for the objects referenced by the right side of the FETCH JOIN
clause, and hence references to the implicitly fetched entities or
elements cannot appear elsewhere in the query.

The following query returns a set of
departments. As a side effect, the associated employees for those
departments are also retrieved, even though they are not part of the
explicit query result. The initialization of the persistent state or
relationship fields or properties of the objects that are retrieved as a
result of a fetch join is determined by the metadata for that class—in
this example, the _Employee_ entity class.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT d
FROM Department d LEFT JOIN FETCH d.employees
WHERE d.deptno = 1
----

A fetch join has the same join semantics as
the corresponding inner or outer join, except that the related objects
specified on the right-hand side of the join operation are not returned
in the query result or otherwise referenced in the query. Hence, for
example, if department 1 has five employees, the above query returns
five references to the department 1 entity.

The FETCH JOIN construct must not be used in
the FROM clause of a subquery.

==== Collection Member Declarations

An identification variable declared by a
collection_member_declaration ranges over values of a collection
obtained by navigation using a path expression.

An identification variable of a collection
member declaration is declared using a special operator, the reserved
identifier IN. The argument to the IN operator is a collection-valued
path expression. The path expression evaluates to a collection type
specified as a result of navigation to a collection-valued association
field of an entity or embeddable class abstract schema type.

The syntax for declaring a collection member
identification variable is as follows:

----
collection_member_declaration ::=
    IN (collection_valued_path_expression) [AS] identification_variable
----

For example, the query

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT o
FROM Order o JOIN o.lineItems l
WHERE l.product.productType = 'office_supplies'
----

can equivalently be expressed as follows, using the IN operator:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT o
FROM Order o, IN(o.lineItems) l
WHERE l.product.productType = 'office_supplies'
----

In this example, lineItems is the name of an
association field whose value is a collection of instances of the
abstract schema type LineItem. The identification variable _l_
designates a member of this collection, a single LineItem abstract
schema type instance. In this example, _o_ is an identification variable
of the abstract schema type Order.

==== FROM Clause and SQL [[a4957]]

The Jakarta Persistence query language treats
the FROM clause similarly to SQL in that the declared identification
variables affect the results of the query even if they are not used in
the WHERE clause. Application developers should use caution in defining
identification variables because the domain of the query can depend on
whether there are any values of the declared type.

For example, the FROM clause below defines a
query over all orders that have line items and existing products. If
there are no _Product_ instances in the database, the domain of the
query is empty and no order is selected.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT o
FROM Order AS o JOIN o.lineItems l JOIN l.product p
----

==== Polymorphism

Jakarta Persistence queries are automatically
polymorphic. The FROM clause of a query designates not only instances of
the specific entity class(es) to which it explicitly refers but
instances of subclasses of those classes as well. The instances returned
by a query thus include instances of the subclasses that satisfy the
query criteria.

Non-polymorphic queries or queries whose
polymorphism is restricted can be specified using entity type
expressions in the WHERE clause to restrict the domain of the query. See
<<a5381>>.

==== Downcasting [[a4965]]

The use of the TREAT operator is supported
for downcasting within path expressions in the FROM and WHERE clauses.
Use of the TREAT operator allows access to subclass-specific state.

If during query execution the first argument
to the TREAT operator is not a subtype (proper or improper) of the
target type, the path is considered to have no value, and does not
participate in the determination of the result. That is, in the case of
a join, the referenced object does not participate in the result, and in
the case of a restriction, the associated predicate is false. Use of the
TREAT operator therefore also has the effect of filtering on the
specified type (and its subtypes) as well as performing the downcast. If
the target type is not a subtype (proper or improper) of the static type
of the first argument, the query is invalid.

Examples:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT b.name, b.ISBN
FROM Order o JOIN TREAT(o.product AS Book) b

SELECT e FROM Employee e JOIN TREAT(e.projects AS LargeProject) lp
WHERE lp.budget > 1000

SELECT e FROM Employee e JOIN e.projects p
WHERE TREAT(p AS LargeProject).budget > 1000
    OR TREAT(p AS SmallProject).name LIKE 'Persist%'
    OR p.description LIKE "cost overrun"

SELECT e FROM Employee e
WHERE TREAT(e AS Exempt).vacationDays > 10
    OR TREAT(e AS Contractor).hours > 100
----

=== WHERE Clause [[a4985]]

The WHERE clause of a query consists of a
conditional expression used to select objects or values that satisfy the
expression. The WHERE clause restricts the result of a select statement
or the scope of an update or delete operation.

A WHERE clause is defined as follows:

----
where_clause ::= WHERE conditional_expression
----

The GROUP BY construct enables the
aggregation of values according to the properties of an entity class.
The HAVING construct enables conditions to be specified that further
restrict the query result as restrictions upon the groups.

The syntax of the HAVING clause is as follows:

----
having_clause ::= HAVING conditional_expression
----

The GROUP BY and HAVING constructs are
further discussed in <<a5410>>.

=== Conditional Expressions [[a4994]]

The following sections describe language
constructs that can be used in a conditional expression of the WHERE
clause, the HAVING clause, or in an ON condition.

State fields that are mapped in serialized
form or as lobs cannot be portably used in conditional
footnote:[The implementation is
not expected to perform such query operations involving such fields in
memory rather than in the database.].

==== Literals

A string literal is enclosed in single
quotes—for example: 'literal'. A string literal that includes a single
quote is represented by two single quotes—for example: 'literal''s'.
String literals in queries, like Java _String_ literals, use unicode
character encoding. The use of Java escape notation is not supported in
query string literals.

Exact numeric literals support the use of
Java integer literal syntax as well as SQL exact numeric literal syntax.

Approximate literals support the use Java
floating point literal syntax as well as SQL approximate numeric literal
syntax.

Appropriate suffixes can be used to indicate
the specific type of a numeric literal in accordance with the Java
Language Specification. Support for the use of hexadecimal and octal
numeric literals is not required by this specification.

Enum literals support the use of Java enum
literal syntax. The fully qualified enum class name must be specified.

The JDBC escape syntax may be used for the
specification of date, time, and timestamp literals. For example:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT o
FROM Customer c JOIN c.orders o
WHERE c.name = 'Smith'
    AND o.submissionDate < {d '2008-12-31'}
----

The portability of this syntax for date,
time, and timestamp literals is dependent upon the JDBC driver in use.
Persistence providers are not required to translate from this syntax
into the native syntax of the database or driver.

The boolean literals are _TRUE_ and _FALSE_.

Entity type literals are specified by entity names—for example: _Customer_.

Although reserved literals appear in upper case, they are case insensitive.

==== Identification Variables

All identification variables used in the
WHERE or HAVING clause of a SELECT or DELETE statement must be declared
in the FROM clause, as described in <<a4765>>. The identification variables used in the
WHERE clause of an UPDATE statement must be declared in the UPDATE
clause.

Identification variables are existentially
quantified in the WHERE and HAVING clause.
This means that an identification variable represents a member of a
collection or an instance of an entity's abstract schema type. An
identification variable never designates a collection in its entirety.

==== Path Expressions

It is illegal to use a
_collection_valued_path_expression_ within a WHERE or HAVING clause as
part of a conditional expression except in an
_empty_collection_comparison_expression,_ in a
_collection_member_expression_, or as an argument to the SIZE operator.

==== Input Parameters

Either positional or named parameters may be
used. Positional and named parameters must not be mixed in a single
query.

Input parameters can only be used in the
WHERE clause or HAVING clause of a query or
as the new value for an update item in the SET clause of an update
statement.

[NOTE]
====
Note that if an input parameter value is
null, comparison operations or arithmetic operations involving the input
parameter will return an unknown value. See <<a5676>>.
====

All input parameters must be single-valued,
except in IN expressions (see <<a5107>>), which support the use of collection-valued input
parameters.

The API for the binding of query parameters
is described in <<a1060>>.

===== Positional Parameters

The following rules apply to positional
parameters.

* Input parameters are designated by the
question mark (_?_) prefix followed by an integer. For example: _?1_.
* Input parameters are numbered starting from 1.
* The same parameter can be used more than once in the query string.
* The ordering of the use of parameters within
the query string need not conform to the order of the positional
parameters.

===== Named Parameters

A named parameter is denoted by an identifier
that is prefixed by the ":" symbol. It follows the rules for identifiers
defined in <<a4760>>. Named parameters are case sensitive.

Example:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c
FROM Customer c
WHERE c.status = :stat
----

The same named parameter can be used more than once in the query string.

==== Conditional Expression Composition

Conditional expressions are composed of other
conditional expressions, comparison operations, logical operations, path
expressions that evaluate to boolean values, boolean literals, and
boolean input parameters.

The scalar expressions described in <<a5243>> can be used in
conditional expressions.

Aggregate functions can only be used in
conditional expressions in a HAVING clause. See <<a5410>>.

Standard bracketing _()_ for ordering expression evaluation is supported.

Conditional expressions are defined as follows:

----
conditional_expression ::= conditional_term | conditional_expression OR conditional_term
conditional_term ::= conditional_factor | conditional_term AND conditional_factor
conditional_factor ::= [NOT] conditional_primary
conditional_primary ::= simple_cond_expression | (conditional_expression)
simple_cond_expression ::=
    comparison_expression |
    between_expression |
    in_expression |
    like_expression |
    null_comparison_expression |
    empty_collection_comparison_expression |
    collection_member_expression |
    exists_expression
----

==== Operators and Operator Precedence

The operators are listed below in order of decreasing precedence.

* Navigation operator (_._)
* Arithmetic operators:
** +, - unary
** *, / multiplication and division
** +, - addition and subtraction
* Comparison operators: _=_, _>_, _>=_, _<_
, _<=_, _<>_ (not equal), _[NOT]_ _BETWEEN_, _[NOT]_ _LIKE_, _[NOT]_
_IN_, _IS_ _[NOT]_ _NULL_, _IS_ _[NOT]_ _EMPTY_, _[NOT]_ _MEMBER_
_[OF]_, _[NOT]_ _EXISTS_
* Logical operators:
** _NOT_
** _AND_
** _OR_

The following sections describe operators used in specific expressions.

==== Comparison Expressions [[a5066]]

The syntax for the use of comparison
expressions in a conditional expression is as
followsfootnote:[Note that queries
that contain subqueries on both sides of a comparison operation will not
be portable across all databases.]:

----
comparison_expression ::=
    string_expression comparison_operator {string_expression | all_or_any_expression} |
    boolean_expression {= | <>} {boolean_expression | all_or_any_expression} |
    enum_expression {= | <>} {enum_expression | all_or_any_expression} |
    datetime_expression comparison_operator
        {datetime_expression | all_or_any_expression} |
    entity_expression {= | <>} {entity_expression | all_or_any_expression} |
    arithmetic_expression comparison_operator
        {arithmetic_expression | all_or_any_expression} |
    entity_type_expression {= | <>} entity_type_expression}

comparison_operator ::= = | > | >= | < | <= | <>
----

Examples:

----
item.cost * 1.08 <= 100.00
CONCAT(person.lastName, ', ', person.firstName)) = 'Jones, Sam'
TYPE(e) = ExemptEmployee
----

==== Between Expressions

The syntax for the use of the comparison operator [NOT] BETWEEN in a
conditional expression is as follows:

----
 between_expression ::=
    arithmetic_expression [NOT] BETWEEN arithmetic_expression AND arithmetic_expression |
    string_expression [NOT] BETWEEN string_expression AND string_expression |
    datetime_expression [NOT] BETWEEN datetime_expression AND datetime_expression
----

The BETWEEN expression

----
x BETWEEN y AND z
----

is semantically equivalent to:

----
y <= x AND x <= z
----

The rules for unknown and NULL values in
comparison operations apply. See <<a5676>>.

Examples:

----
p.age BETWEEN 15 and 19 is equivalent to p.age >= 15 AND p.age <= 19
p.age NOT BETWEEN 15 and 19 is equivalent to p.age < 15 OR p.age > 19
----

In the following example,
_transactionHistory_ is a list of credit card transactions defined using
an order column.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT t
FROM CreditCard c JOIN c.transactionHistory t
WHERE c.holder.name = 'John Doe' AND INDEX(t) BETWEEN 0 AND 9
----

==== In Expressions [[a5107]]

The syntax for the use of the comparison
operator [NOT] IN in a conditional expression is as follows:

----
in_expression ::=
    {state_valued_path_expression | type_discriminator} [NOT] IN
        {(in_item {, in_item}*) | (subquery) | collection_valued_input_parameter}
in_item ::= literal | single_valued_input_parameter
----

The state_valued_path_expression must have
a string, numeric, date, time, timestamp, or enum value.

The literal and/or input parameter values
must be _like_ the same abstract schema type of the
_state_valued_path_expression_ in type. (See <<a5735>>).

The results of the subquery must be _like_
the same abstract schema type of the state_valued_path_expression in
type. Subqueries are discussed in <<a5196>>.

Example 1:

[source, sql]
----
o.country IN ('UK', 'US', 'France')
----

is true for _UK_ and false for _Peru_, and is equivalent to the expression

[source, sql]
----
(o.country = 'UK') OR (o.country = 'US') OR (o.country = 'France')
----

Example 2:

[source, sql]
----
o.country NOT IN ('UK', 'US', 'France')
----

is false for _UK_ and true for _Peru_, and is equivalent to the expression

[source, sql]
----
NOT ((o.country = 'UK') OR (o.country = 'US') OR (o.country = 'France'))
----

There must be at least one element in the
comma separated list that defines the set of values for the _IN_
expression.

If the value of a
state_valued_path_expression or _in_item_ in an IN or NOT IN expression
is _NULL_ or unknown, the value of the expression is unknown.

Note that use of a collection-valued input
parameter will mean that a static query cannot be precompiled.

==== Like Expressions

The syntax for the use of the comparison
operator [NOT] LIKE in a conditional expression is as follows:

----
like_expression ::=
    string_expression [NOT] LIKE pattern_value [ESCAPE escape_character]
----

The _string_expression_ must have a string
value. The _pattern_value_ is a string literal or a string-valued input
parameter in which an underscore (___) stands for any single
character, a percent (_%_) character stands for any sequence of
characters (including the empty sequence), and all other characters
stand for themselves. The optional _escape_character_ __ is a
single-character string literal or a character-valued input parameter
(i.e., _char_ or _Character_) and is used to escape the special meaning
of the underscore and percent characters in _pattern_value_
_.footnote:[Refer to <<a19494>> for a more precise characterization of these rules.]

Examples:

* _address.phone LIKE '12%3'_ is true for '123', '12993' and false for '1234'
* _asentence.word LIKE 'l_se'_ is true for 'lose' and false for 'loose'
* _aword.underscored LIKE '\_%' ESCAPE '\'_ is true for '_foo' and false for 'bar'
* _address.phone NOT LIKE '12%3'_ is false for '123' and '12993' and true for '1234'

If the value of the _string_expression_ or
_pattern_value_ is _NULL_ or unknown, the value of the LIKE expression
is unknown. If the _escape_character_ is specified and is _NULL_, the
value of the LIKE expression is unknown.

==== Null Comparison Expressions

The syntax for the use of the comparison
operator IS NULL in a conditional expression is as follows:

----
null_comparison_expression ::=
    {single_valued_path_expression | input_parameter} IS [NOT] NULL
----

A null comparison expression tests whether or
not the single-valued path expression or input parameter is a _NULL_
value.

Null comparisons over instances of embeddable
class types are not supported. Support for comparisons over embeddables
may be added in a future release of this specification.

==== Empty Collection Comparison Expressions [[a5139]]

The syntax for the use of the comparison
operator IS EMPTY in an _empty_collection_comparison_expression_ is as
follows:

----
empty_collection_comparison_expression ::=
    collection_valued_path_expression IS [NOT] EMPTY
----

This expression tests whether or not the
collection designated by the collection-valued path expression is empty
(i.e, has no elements).

Example:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT o
FROM Order o
WHERE o.lineItems IS EMPTY
----

If the value of the collection-valued path
expression in an empty collection comparison expression is unknown, the
value of the empty comparison expression is unknown.

==== Collection Member Expressions [[a5150]]

The syntax for the use of the comparison
operator MEMBER OFfootnote:[The use of the
reserved word OF is optional in this expression.] in an
_collection_member_expression_ is as follows:

----
collection_member_expression ::=
    entity_or_value_expression [NOT] MEMBER [OF] collection_valued_path_expression
entity_or_value_expression ::=
    single_valued_object_path_expression |
    state_valued_path_expression |
    simple_entity_or_value_expression
simple_entity_or_value_expression ::=
    identification_variable |
    input_parameter |
    literal
----

This expression tests whether the designated
value is a member of the collection specified by the collection-valued
path expression.

Expressions that evaluate to embeddable types
are not supported in collection member expressions. Support for use of
embeddables in collection member expressions may be added in a future
release of this specification.

If the collection valued path expression
designates an empty collection, the value of the MEMBER OF expression is
FALSE and the value of the NOT MEMBER OF expression is TRUE. Otherwise,
if the value of the _collection_valued_path_expression_
or _entity_or_value_expression_ in the
collection member expression is _NULL_ or unknown, the value of the
collection member expression is unknown.

Example:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT p
FROM Person p
WHERE 'Joe' MEMBER OF p.nicknames
----

==== Exists Expressions

An EXISTS expression is a predicate that is
true only if the result of the subquery consists of one or more values
and that is false otherwise.

The syntax of an exists expression is

----
exists_expression ::= [NOT] EXISTS (subquery)
----

Example:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT emp
FROM Employee emp
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT spouseEmp
    FROM Employee spouseEmp
        WHERE spouseEmp = emp.spouse)
----

The result of this query consists of all
employees whose spouses are also employees.

==== All or Any Expressions

An ALL conditional expression is a predicate
over a subquery that is true if the comparison operation is true for all
values in the result of the subquery or the result of the subquery is
empty. An ALL conditional expression is false if the result of the
comparison is false for at least one value of the result of the
subquery, and is unknown if neither true nor false.

An ANY conditional expression is a predicate
over a subquery that is true if the comparison operation is true for
some value in the result of the subquery. An ANY conditional expression
is false if the result of the subquery is empty or if the comparison
operation is false for every value in the result of the subquery, and is
unknown if neither true nor false. The keyword SOME is synonymous with
ANY.

The comparison operators used with ALL or ANY
conditional expressions are =, <, <=, >, >=, <>. The result of the
subquery must be like that of the other argument to the comparison
operator in type. See <<a5735>>.

The syntax of an ALL or ANY expression is
specified as follows:

----
all_or_any_expression ::= {ALL | ANY | SOME} (subquery)
----

Example:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT emp
FROM Employee emp
WHERE emp.salary > ALL (
    SELECT m.salary
    FROM Manager m
    WHERE m.department = emp.department)
----

The result of this query consists of all
employees whose salaries exceed the salaries of all managers in their
department.

==== Subqueries [[a5196]]

Subqueries may be used in the WHERE or HAVING clause.footnote:[Subqueries are
restricted to the WHERE and HAVING clauses in this release. Support for
subqueries in the FROM clause will be considered in a later release of
this specification.]

The syntax for subqueries is as follows:

----
subquery ::= simple_select_clause subquery_from_clause [where_clause]
    [groupby_clause] [having_clause]
simple_select_clause ::= SELECT [DISTINCT] simple_select_expression
subquery_from_clause ::=
    FROM subselect_identification_variable_declaration
        {, subselect_identification_variable_declaration |
            collection_member_declaration}*
subselect_identification_variable_declaration ::=
    identification_variable_declaration |
    derived_path_expression [AS] identification_variable {join}* |
    derived_collection_member_declaration
simple_select_expression ::=
    single_valued_path_expression |
    scalar_expression |
    aggregate_expression |
    identification_variable
derived_path_expression ::=
    general_derived_path.single_valued_object_field |
    general_derived_path.collection_valued_field
general_derived_path ::=
    simple_derived_path |
    treated_derived_path{.single_valued_object_field}*
simple_derived_path ::= superquery_identification_variable{.single_valued_object_field}*
treated_derived_path ::= TREAT(general_derived_path AS subtype)
derived_collection_member_declaration ::=
    IN superquery_identification_variable.{single_valued_object_field.}*collection_valued_field
----

Examples:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT emp
FROM Employee emp
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT spouseEmp
    FROM Employee spouseEmp
    WHERE spouseEmp = emp.spouse)
----

Note that some contexts in which a subquery
can be used require that the subquery be a scalar subquery (i.e.,
produce a single result). This is illustrated in the following examples
using numeric comparisons.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c
FROM Customer c
WHERE (SELECT AVG(o.price) FROM c.orders o) > 100

SELECT goodCustomer
FROM Customer goodCustomer
WHERE goodCustomer.balanceOwed < (
    SELECT AVG(c.balanceOwed)/2.0 FROM Customer c)
----

==== Scalar Expressions [[a5243]]

Numeric, string, datetime, case, and entity
type expressions result in scalar values.

Scalar expressions may be used in the SELECT
clause of a query as well as in the WHEREfootnote:[Note that expressions
involving aggregate operators must not be used in the WHERE clause.] and
HAVING clauses.

----
scalar_expression::=
    arithmetic_expression |
    string_expression |
    enum_expression |
    datetime_expression |
    boolean_expression |
    case_expression |
    entity_type_expression
----

===== Arithmetic Expressions

The arithmetic operators are:

* +, - unary
* *, / multiplication and division
* +, - addition and subtraction

Arithmetic operations use numeric promotion.

Arithmetic functions are described in <<a5284>>.

===== Built-in String, Arithmetic, and Datetime Functional Expressions

The Jakarta Persistence query language includes
the built-in functions described in <<a5264>>, <<a5284>>,
<<a5304>>, which may be used
in the SELECT, WHERE or HAVING clause of a query. The invocation of
predefined database functions and user-defined database functions is
described in <<a5311>>.

If the value of any argument to a functional
expression is null or unknown, the value of the functional expression is
unknown.

====== String Functions [[a5264]]

----
functions_returning_strings ::=
    CONCAT(string_expression, string_expression {, string_expression}*) |
    SUBSTRING(string_expression,
              arithmetic_expression [, arithmetic_expression]) |
    TRIM([[trim_specification] [trim_character] FROM] string_expression) |
    LOWER(string_expression) |
    UPPER(string_expression)
trim_specification ::= LEADING | TRAILING | BOTH

functions_returning_numerics ::=
    LENGTH(string_expression) |
    LOCATE(string_expression, string_expression[, arithmetic_expression])
----

The CONCAT function returns a string that is
a concatenation of its arguments.

The second and third arguments of the
SUBSTRING function denote the starting position and length of the
substring to be returned. These arguments are integers. The third
argument is optional. If it is not specified, the substring from the
start position to the end of the string is returned. The first position
of a string is denoted by 1. The SUBSTRING function returns a string.

The TRIM function trims the specified
character from a string. If the character to be trimmed is not
specified, it will be assumed to be space (or blank). The optional
_trim_character_ __ is a single-character string literal or a
character-valued input parameter (i.e., _char_ or _Character_
)footnote:[Note that not all
databases support the use of a trim character other than the space
character; use of this argument may result in queries that are not
portable.]. If a trim specification is not provided, it
defaults to BOTH. The TRIM function returns the trimmed string.

The LOWER and UPPER functions convert a
string to lower and upper case, respectively, with regard to the locale
of the database. They return a string.

The LOCATE function returns the
position of a given string within a string, starting the search at a
specified position. It returns the first position at which the string
was found as an integer. The first argument is the string to be located;
the second argument is the string to be searched; the optional third
argument is an integer that represents the string position at which the
search is started (by default, the beginning of the string to be
searched). The first position in a string is denoted by 1. If the string
is not found, 0 is returned.footnote:[Note that not all
databases support the use of the third argument to LOCATE; use of this
argument may result in queries that are not portable.]

The LENGTH function returns the length of the
string in characters as an integer.

====== Arithmetic Functions [[a5284]]

----
functions_returning_numerics ::=
    ABS(arithmetic_expression) |
    SQRT(arithmetic_expression) |
    MOD(arithmetic_expression, arithmetic_expression) |
    SIZE(collection_valued_path_expression) |
    INDEX(identification_variable)
----

The ABS function takes a numeric argument and
returns a number (integer, float, or double) of the same type as the
argument to the function.

The SQRT function takes a numeric argument and returns a double.

The MOD function takes two integer arguments and returns an integer.

Numeric arguments to these functions may
correspond to the numeric Java object types as well as the primitive
numeric types.

The SIZE function returns an integer value,
the number of elements of the collection. If the collection is empty,
the SIZE function evaluates to zero.

The INDEX function returns an integer value
corresponding to the position of its argument in an ordered list. The
INDEX function can only be applied to identification variables denoting
types for which an order column has been specified.

In the following example, _studentWaitlist_
is a list of students for which an order column has been specified:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT w.name
FROM Course c JOIN c.studentWaitlist w
WHERE c.name = 'Calculus'
AND INDEX(w) = 0
----

====== Datetime Functions [[a5304]]

----
functions_returning_datetime :=
    CURRENT_DATE |
    CURRENT_TIME |
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
----

The datetime functions return the value of
current date, time, and timestamp on the database server.

===== Invocation of Predefined and User-defined Database Functions [[a5311]]

The invocation of functions other than the
built-in functions of the Jakarta Persistence query language is supported
by means of the _function_invocation_ syntax. This includes the
invocation of predefined database functions and user-defined database
functions.

----
function_invocation ::= FUNCTION(function_name {, function_arg}*)

function_arg ::=
    literal |
    state_valued_path_expression |
    input_parameter |
    scalar_expression
----

The _function_name_ argument is a string that
denotes the database function that is to be invoked. The arguments must
be suitable for the database function that is to be invoked. The result
of the function must be suitable for the invocation context.

The function may be a database-defined
function or a user-defined function. The function may be a scalar
function or an aggregate function.

Applications that use the
_function_invocation_ syntax will not be portable across databases.

Example:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c
FROM Customer c
WHERE FUNCTION('hasGoodCredit', c.balance, c.creditLimit)
----

===== Case Expressions

The following forms of case
expressions are supported: general case expressions, simple case
expressions, coalesce expressions, and nullif
expressions.footnote:[Note that not all
databases support the use of SQL case expressions. The use of case
expressions may result in queries that are not portable to such
databases.]

----
case_expression ::=
    general_case_expression |
    simple_case_expression |
    coalesce_expression |
    nullif_expression

general_case_expression ::=
    CASE when_clause {when_clause}* ELSE scalar_expression END
when_clause ::= WHEN conditional_expression THEN scalar_expression

simple_case_expression ::=
    CASE case_operand simple_when_clause {simple_when_clause}*
    ELSE scalar_expression
    END
case_operand ::= state_valued_path_expression | type_discriminator
simple_when_clause ::= WHEN scalar_expression THEN scalar_expression

coalesce_expression ::= COALESCE(scalar_expression {, scalar_expression}+)

nullif_expression ::= NULLIF(scalar_expression, scalar_expression)
----

Examples:

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE Employee e
SET e.salary =
    CASE WHEN e.rating = 1 THEN e.salary * 1.1
         WHEN e.rating = 2 THEN e.salary * 1.05
         ELSE e.salary * 1.01
    END

UPDATE Employee e
SET e.salary =
    CASE e.rating WHEN 1 THEN e.salary * 1.1
                  WHEN 2 THEN e.salary * 1.05
                  ELSE e.salary * 1.01
    END

SELECT e.name,
    CASE TYPE(e) WHEN Exempt THEN 'Exempt'
                 WHEN Contractor THEN 'Contractor'
                 WHEN Intern THEN 'Intern'
                 ELSE 'NonExempt'
    END
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.dept.name = 'Engineering'

SELECT e.name,
       f.name,
       CONCAT(CASE WHEN f.annualMiles > 50000 THEN 'Platinum '
                   WHEN f.annualMiles > 25000 THEN 'Gold '
                   ELSE ''
              END,
       'Frequent Flyer')
FROM Employee e JOIN e.frequentFlierPlan f
----

===== Entity Type Expressions [[a5381]]

An entity type expression can be used to
restrict query polymorphism. The TYPE operator returns the exact type of
the argument.

The syntax of an entity type expression is as follows:

----
entity_type_expression ::=
    type_discriminator |
    entity_type_literal |
    input_parameter
type_discriminator ::=
    TYPE(general_identification_variable |
         single_valued_object_path_expression |
         input_parameter)
----

An entity_type_literal is designated by the entity name.

The Java class of the entity is used as an
input parameter to specify the entity type.

Examples:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT e
FROM Employee e
WHERE TYPE(e) IN (Exempt, Contractor)

SELECT e
FROM Employee e
WHERE TYPE(e) IN (:empType1, :empType2)

SELECT e
FROM Employee e
WHERE TYPE(e) IN :empTypes

SELECT TYPE(e)
FROM Employee e
WHERE TYPE(e) <> Exempt
----

=== GROUP BY, HAVING [[a5410]]

The GROUP BY construct enables the
aggregation of result values according to a set of properties. The
HAVING construct enables conditions to be specified that further
restrict the query result. Such conditions are restrictions upon the
groups.

The syntax of the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses is as follows:

----
groupby_clause ::= GROUP BY groupby_item {, groupby_item}*
groupby_item ::= single_valued_path_expression | identification_variable

having_clause ::= HAVING conditional_expression
----

If a query contains both a WHERE clause and a
GROUP BY clause, the effect is that of first applying the where clause,
and then forming the groups and filtering them according to the HAVING
clause. The HAVING clause causes those groups to be retained that
satisfy the condition of the HAVING clause.

The requirements for the SELECT clause when
GROUP BY is used follow those of SQL: namely, any item that appears in
the SELECT clause (other than as an aggregate function or as an argument
to an aggregate function) must also appear in the GROUP BY clause. In
forming the groups, null values are treated as the same for grouping
purposes.

Grouping by an entity is permitted. In this
case, the entity must contain no serialized state fields or lob-valued
state fields that are eagerly fetched. Grouping by an entity that
contains serialized state fields or lob-valued state fields is not
portable, since the implementation is permitted to eagerly fetch fields
or properties that have been specified as LAZY.

Grouping by embeddables is not supported.

The HAVING clause is used to filter over the
groups, and can contain aggregate functions over attributes included in
the groups and/or functions or other query language operators over the
attributes that are used for grouping. It is not required that an
aggregate function used in the HAVING clause also be used in the SELECT
clause.

If there is no GROUP BY clause and the HAVING
clause is used, the result is treated as a single group, and the select
list can only consist of aggregate functions. The use of HAVING in the
absence of GROUP BY is not required to be supported by an implementation
of this specification. Portable applications should not rely on HAVING
without the use of GROUP BY.

Examples:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c.status, AVG(c.filledOrderCount), COUNT(c)
FROM Customer c
GROUP BY c.status
HAVING c.status IN (1, 2)

SELECT c.country, COUNT(c)
FROM Customer c
GROUP BY c.country
HAVING COUNT(c) > 30

SELECT c, COUNT(o)
FROM Customer c JOIN c.orders o
GROUP BY c
HAVING COUNT(o) >= 5
----

=== SELECT Clause [[a5438]]

The SELECT clause denotes the query result.
More than one value may be returned from the SELECT clause of a query.

The SELECT clause can contain one or more of
the following elements: an identification variable that ranges over an
abstract schema type, a single-valued path expression, a scalar
expression, an aggregate expression, a constructor expression.

The SELECT clause has the following syntax:

----
select_clause ::= SELECT [DISTINCT] select_item {, select_item}*
select_item ::= select_expression [[AS] result_variable]
select_expression ::=
    single_valued_path_expression |
    scalar_expression |
    aggregate_expression |
    identification_variable |
    OBJECT(identification_variable) |
    constructor_expression
constructor_expression ::=
    NEW constructor_name (constructor_item {, constructor_item}*)
constructor_item ::=
    single_valued_path_expression |
    scalar_expression |
    aggregate_expression |
    identification_variable
aggregate_expression ::=
    {AVG | MAX | MIN | SUM} ([DISTINCT] state_valued_path_expression) |
     COUNT ([DISTINCT] identification_variable | state_valued_path_expression |
         single_valued_object_path_expression) |
     function_invocation
----

For example:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c.id, c.status
FROM Customer c JOIN c.orders o
WHERE o.count > 100
----

In the following example, _videoInventory_ is
a Map from the entity _Movie_ to the number of copies in stock:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT v.location.street, KEY(i).title, VALUE(i)
FROM VideoStore v JOIN v.videoInventory i
WHERE v.location.zipcode = '94301' AND VALUE(i) > 0
----

Note that the SELECT clause must be specified
to return only single-valued expressions. The query below is therefore
not valid:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT o.lineItems FROM Order AS o
----

The DISTINCT
keyword is used to specify that duplicate values must be eliminated from
the query result.

If DISTINCT is not specified, duplicate
values are not eliminated.

The result of DISTINCT over embeddable
objects or map _entry_ results is undefined.

Standalone identification variables in the
SELECT clause may optionally be qualified by the
OBJECT operator.footnote:[Note that the keyword
OBJECT is not required. It is preferred that it be omitted for new
queries.] The
SELECT clause must not use the OBJECT operator to qualify path
expressions.

A _result_variable_ may be used to
name a _select_item_ in the query result.footnote:[This can be used, for
example, to refer to a select expression in the ORDER BY clause.]

Example:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c, COUNT(l) AS itemCount
FROM Customer c JOIN c.Orders o JOIN o.lineItems l
WHERE c.address.state = 'CA'
GROUP BY c
ORDER BY itemCount
----


==== Result Type of the SELECT Clause

The type of the query result specified by the
SELECT clause of a query is an entity
abstract schema type, a state field type,
the result of a scalar expression, the result of an aggregate function,
the result of a construction operation, or some sequence of these.

The result type of the SELECT clause is
defined by the the result types of the select expressions contained in
it. When multiple select expressions are used in the SELECT clause, the
elements in this result correspond in order to the order of their
specification in the SELECT clause and in type to the result types of
each of the select expressions.

The type of the result of a select_expression
is as follows:

* The result type of an identification_variable
is the type of the entity object or embeddable object to which the
identification variable corresponds. The type of an
identification_variable that refers to an entity abstract schema type is
the type of the entity to which that identification variable corresponds
or a subtype as determined by the object/relational mapping.
* The result type of a
single_valued_path_expression that is a state_field_path_expression is
the same type as the corresponding state field of the entity or
embeddable class. If the state field of the entity is a primitive type,
the result type is the corresponding object type.
* The result type of a
single_valued_path_expression that is a
single_valued_object_path_expression is the type of the entity object or
embeddable object to which the path expression corresponds. A
single_valued_object_path_expression that results in an entity object
will result in an entity of the type of the relationship field or the
subtype of the relationship field of the entity object as determined by
the object/relational mapping.
* The result type of a
single_valued_path_expression that is an _identification_variable_ to
which the KEY or VALUE function has been applied is determined by the
type of the map key or value respectively, as defined by the above
rules.
* The result type of a
single_valued_path_expression that is an _identification_variable_ to
which the ENTRY function has been applied is _java.util.Map.Entry_,
where the key and value types of the map entry are determined by the
above rules as applied to the map key and map value respectively.
* The result type of a _scalar_expression_ is
the type of the scalar value to which the expression evaluates. The
result type of a numeric _scalar_expression_ is defined in <<a5574>>.
* The result type of an
_entity_type_expression_ scalar expression is the Java class to which
the resulting abstract schema type corresponds.
* The result type of aggregate_expression is
defined in <<a5538>>.
* The result type of a constructor_expression
is the type of the class for which the constructor is defined. The types
of the arguments to the constructor are defined by the above rules.

==== Constructor Expressions in the SELECT Clause [[a5500]]

A constructor may be used in the SELECT list
to return an instance of a Java class. The specified class is not
required to be an entity or to be mapped to the database. The
constructor name must be fully qualified.

If an entity class name is specified as the
constructor name in the SELECT NEW clause, the resulting entity
instances will be in either the new or the detached state, depending on
whether a primary key is retrieved for the constructed object.

If a _single_valued_path_expression_ or
_identification_variable_ that is an argument to the constructor
references an entity, the resulting entity instance referenced by that
_single_valued_path_expression_ or _identification_variable_ will be in
the managed state.

For example,

[source,sql]
----
SELECT NEW com.acme.example.CustomerDetails(c.id, c.status, o.count)
FROM Customer c JOIN c.orders o
WHERE o.count > 100
----

==== Null Values in the Query Result

If the result of a query corresponds to an
association field or state field whose value is null, that null value is
returned in the result of the query method. The IS NOT NULL construct
can be used to eliminate such null values from the result set of the
query.

Note, however, that state field types defined
in terms of Java numeric primitive types cannot produce NULL values in
the query result. A query that returns such a state field type as a
result type must not return a null value.

==== Embeddables in the Query Result [[a5511]]

If the result of a query corresponds to an
identification variable or state field whose value is an embeddable, the
embeddable instance returned by the query will not be in the managed
state (i.e., it will not be part of the state of any managed entity).

In the following example, the _Address_
instances returned by the query will reference _Phone_ instances. While
the _Phone_ instances will be managed, the _Address_ instances
referenced by the _addr_ result variable will not be. Modifications to
these embeddable instances will have no effect on persistent state.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    int id;

    Address address;

    // ...
}

@Embeddable
public class Address {
    String street;

    // ...

    @OneToOne
    Phone phone; // fetch=EAGER
}

@Entity
public class Phone {
    @Id
    int id;

    // ...

    @OneToOne(mappedBy="address.phone")
    Employee emp; // fetch=EAGER
}
----

[source,sql]
----
SELECT e.address AS addr
FROM Employee e
----

==== Aggregate Functions in the SELECT Clause [[a5538]]

The result of a query may be the result of an
aggregate function applied to a path expression.

The following aggregate functions can be used
in the SELECT clause of a query: AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, aggregate
functions defined in the database.

For all aggregate functions except COUNT, the
path expression that is the argument to the aggregate function must
terminate in a state field. The path expression argument to COUNT may
terminate in either a state field or a association field, or the
argument to COUNT may be an identification variable.

Arguments to the functions SUM and AVG must
be numeric. Arguments to the functions MAX and MIN must correspond to
orderable state field types (i.e., numeric types, string types,
character types, or date types).

The Java type that is contained in the result
of a query using an aggregate function is as follows:

* COUNT returns Long.
* MAX, MIN return the type of the state field to which they are applied.
* AVG returns Double.
* SUM returns Long when applied to state fields
of integral types (other than BigInteger); Double when applied to state
fields of floating point types; BigInteger when applied to state fields
of type BigInteger; and BigDecimal when applied to state fields of type
BigDecimal.

Null values are eliminated before the
aggregate function is applied, regardless of whether the keyword
DISTINCT is specified.

If SUM, AVG, MAX, or MIN is used, and there
are no values to which the aggregate function can be applied, the result
of the aggregate function is NULL.

If COUNT is used, and there are no values to
which COUNT can be applied, the result of the aggregate function is 0.

The argument to an aggregate function
may be preceded by the keyword DISTINCT to specify that duplicate values
are to be eliminated before the aggregate function is
applied.footnote:[It is legal to
specify DISTINCT with MAX or MIN, but it does not affect the result.]

The use of DISTINCT with COUNT is not
supported for arguments of embeddable types or map entry types.

The invocation of aggregate database
functions, including user defined functions, is supported by means of
the FUNCTION operator. See <<a5311>>.

===== Examples

The following query returns the average order quantity:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT AVG(o.quantity) FROM Order o
----

The following query returns the total cost of
the items that John Smith has ordered.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT SUM(l.price)
FROM Order o JOIN o.lineItems l JOIN o.customer c
WHERE c.lastname = 'Smith' AND c.firstname = 'John'
----

The following query returns the total number of orders.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT COUNT(o) FROM Order o
----

The following query counts the number of
items in John Smith's order for which prices have been specified.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT COUNT(l.price)
FROM Order o JOIN o.lineItems l JOIN o.customer c
WHERE c.lastname = 'Smith' AND c.firstname = 'John'
----

Note that this is equivalent to:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT COUNT(l)
FROM Order o JOIN o.lineItems l JOIN o.customer c
WHERE c.lastname = 'Smith' AND c.firstname = 'John' AND l.price IS NOT NULL
----

==== Numeric Expressions in the SELECT Clause [[a5574]]

The type of a numeric expression in the query
result is determined as follows:

* An operand that corresponds to a persistent
state field is of the same type as that persistent state field.
* An operand that corresponds to one of
arithmetic functions described in <<a5284>> is of the type
defined by <<a5284>>.
* An operand that corresponds to one of an
aggregate functions described in <<a5538>> is of the type defined by
<<a5538>>.

The result of a case expression, coalesce
expression, nullif expression, or arithmetic expression (+, -, *, /) is
determined by applying the following rule to its
operandsfootnote:[In the case of a
general or simple case expression, these are the scalar expressions of
the THEN and ELSE clauses.].

* If there is an operand of type Double or
double, the result of the operation is of type Double;
* otherwise, if there is an operand of type
Float or float, the result of the operation is of type Float;
* otherwise, if there is an operand of type
BigDecimal, the result of the operation is of type BigDecimal;
* otherwise, if there is an operand of type
BigInteger, the result of the operation is of type BigInteger, unless
the operator is / (division), in which case the numeric result type is
not further defined;
* otherwise, if there is an operand of type
Long or long, the result of the operation is of type Long, unless the
operator is / (division), in which case the numeric result type is not
further defined;
* otherwise, if there is an operand of integral
type, the result of the operation is of type Integer, unless the
operator is / (division), in which case the numeric result type is not
further defined.

[NOTE]
====
Users should note that the semantics of the
SQL division operation are not standard across databases. In particular,
when both operands are of integral types, the result of the division
operation will be an integral type in some databases, and an
non-integral type in others. Portable applications should not assume a
particular result type.
====

=== ORDER BY Clause [[a5587]]

The ORDER BY clause allows the objects or
values that are returned by the query to be ordered.

The syntax of the ORDER BY clause is

----
orderby_clause ::= ORDER BY orderby_item {, orderby_item}*
orderby_item ::=
    {state_field_path_expression | general_identification_variable | result_variable}
        [ASC | DESC]
----

An orderby_item must be one of the following:

. A _state_field_path_expression_ that
evaluates to an orderable state field of an entity or embeddable class
abstract schema type designated in the SELECT clause by one of the
following:
* a _general_identification_variable_
* a _single_valued_object_path_expression_
. A _state_field_path_expression_ that
evaluates to the same state field of the same entity or embeddable
abstract schema type as a _state_field_path_expression_ in the SELECT
clause
. A general_identification_variable that
evaluates to the same map field of the same entity or embeddable
abstract schema type as a general_identification_variable in the SELECT
clause
. A _result_variable_ that refers to an
orderable item in the SELECT clause for which the same _result_variable_
has been specified. This may be the result of an _aggregate_expression_
, a _scalar_expression_, or a _state_field_path_expression_ in the
SELECT clause.

For example, the four queries below are legal.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT o
FROM Customer c JOIN c.orders o JOIN c.address a
WHERE a.state = 'CA'
ORDER BY o.quantity DESC, o.totalcost

SELECT o.quantity, a.zipcode
FROM Customer c JOIN c.orders o JOIN c.address a
WHERE a.state = 'CA'
ORDER BY o.quantity, a.zipcode

SELECT o.quantity, o.cost*1.08 AS taxedCost, a.zipcode
FROM Customer c JOIN c.orders o JOIN c.address a
WHERE a.state = 'CA' AND a.county = 'Santa Clara'
ORDER BY o.quantity, taxedCost, a.zipcode

SELECT AVG(o.quantity) as q, a.zipcode
FROM Customer c JOIN c.orders o JOIN c.address a
WHERE a.state = 'CA'
GROUP BY a.zipcode
ORDER BY q DESC
----

The following two queries are _not_ legal
because the _orderby_item_ is not reflected in the SELECT clause of the
query.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT p.product_name
FROM Order o JOIN o.lineItems l JOIN l.product p JOIN o.customer c
WHERE c.lastname = 'Smith' AND c.firstname = 'John'
ORDER BY p.price

SELECT p.product_name
FROM Order o, IN(o.lineItems) l JOIN o.customer c
WHERE c.lastname = 'Smith' AND c.firstname = 'John'
ORDER BY o.quantity
----

If more than one _orderby_item_ is specified,
the left-to-right sequence of the _orderby_item_ elements determines the
precedence, whereby the leftmost _orderby_item_ has highest precedence.

The keyword ASC specifies that ascending
ordering be used for the associated _orderby_item_; the keyword DESC
specifies that descending ordering be used. Ascending ordering is the
default.

SQL rules for the ordering of null values
apply: that is, all null values must appear before all non-null values
in the ordering or all null values must appear after all non-null values
in the ordering, but it is not specified which.

The ordering of the query result is preserved
in the result of the query execution method if the ORDER BY clause is
used.

=== Bulk Update and Delete Operations [[a5636]]

Bulk update and delete operations apply to
entities of a single entity class (together with its subclasses, if
any). Only one entity abstract schema type may be specified in the FROM
or UPDATE clause.

The syntax of these operations is as follows:

----
update_statement ::= update_clause [where_clause]
update_clause ::= UPDATE entity_name [[AS] identification_variable]
                  SET update_item {, update_item}*
update_item ::= [identification_variable.]{single_valued_embeddable_object_field.}*
    {state_field | single_valued_object_field} = new_value
new_value ::=
    scalar_expression |
    simple_entity_expression |
    NULL

delete_statement ::= delete_clause [where_clause]
delete_clause ::= DELETE FROM entity_name [[AS] identification_variable]
----

The syntax of the WHERE clause is described
in <<a4985>>.

A delete operation only applies to entities
of the specified class and its subclasses. It does not cascade to
related entities.

The new_value specified for an update
operation must be compatible in type with the field to which it is
assigned.

Bulk update maps directly to a database
update operation, bypassing optimistic locking checks. Portable
applications must manually update the value of the version column, if
desired, and/or manually validate the value of the version column.

The persistence context is not synchronized
with the result of the bulk update or delete.

[NOTE]
====
Caution should be used when executing bulk
update or delete operations because they may result in inconsistencies
between the database and the entities in the active persistence context.
In general, bulk update and delete operations should only be performed
within a transaction in a new persistence context or before fetching or
accessing entities whose state might be affected by such operations._
====

Examples:

[source,sql]
----
DELETE
FROM Customer c
WHERE c.status = 'inactive'

DELETE
FROM Customer c
WHERE c.status = 'inactive'
    AND c.orders IS EMPTY

UPDATE Customer c
SET c.status = 'outstanding'
WHERE c.balance < 10000

UPDATE Employee e
SET e.address.building = 22
WHERE e.address.building = 14
    AND e.address.city = 'Santa Clara'
    AND e.project = 'Jakarta EE'
----

=== Null Values [[a5676]]

When the target of a reference does not exist
in the database, its value is regarded as _NULL_. SQL _NULL_ semantics
<<a19494>> defines the evaluation of
conditional expressions containing _NULL_ values.

The following is a brief description of these semantics:

* Comparison or arithmetic operations with a
NULL value always yield an unknown value.
* Two NULL values are not considered to be
equal, the comparison yields an unknown value.
* Comparison or arithmetic operations with an
unknown value always yield an unknown value.
* The IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators convert
a _NULL_ state field or single-valued object field value into the
respective TRUE or FALSE value.
* Boolean operators use three valued logic,
defined by <<a5686, Table 1>>, <<a5705, Table 2>>, and <<a5724, Table 3>>.

[NOTE]
====
The Jakarta Persistence query language
defines the empty string, '', as a string
with 0 length, which is not equal to a NULL value. However, NULL values
and empty strings may not always be distinguished when queries are
mapped to some databases. Application developers should therefore not
rely on the semantics of query comparisons involving the empty string
and NULL value.
====

=== Equality and Comparison Semantics [[a5735]]

Only the values of _like_ types are permitted
to be compared. A type is _like_ another type if they correspond to the
same Java language type, or if one is a primitive Java language type and
the other is the wrapped Java class type equivalent (e.g., _int_ and
_Integer_ are like types in this sense). There is one exception to this
rule: it is valid to compare numeric values for which the rules of
numeric promotion apply. Conditional expressions attempting to compare
non-like type values are disallowed except for this numeric case.

[NOTE]
====
Note that the arithmetic operators and
comparison operators are permitted to be applied to state fields and
input parameters of the wrapped Java class equivalents to the primitive
numeric Java types.
====

Two entities of the same abstract schema type
are equal if and only if they have the same primary key value.

Only equality/inequality comparisons over
enums are required to be supported.

Comparisons over instances of embeddable
class or map entry types are not supported.

=== Examples

The following examples illustrate the syntax
and semantics of the Jakarta Persistence query language. These examples are
based on the example presented in <<a4713>>.

==== Simple Queries

Find all orders:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT o
FROM Order o
----

Find all orders that need to be shipped to California:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT o
FROM Order o
WHERE o.shippingAddress.state = 'CA'
----

Find all states for which there are orders:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT o.shippingAddress.state
FROM Order o
----

==== Queries with Relationships

Find all orders that have line items:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT o
FROM Order o JOIN o.lineItems l
----

Note that the result of this query does not
include orders with no associated line items. This query can also be
written as:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT o
FROM Order o
WHERE o.lineItems IS NOT EMPTY
----

Find all orders that have no line items:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT o
FROM Order o
WHERE o.lineItems IS EMPTY
----

Find all pending orders:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT o
FROM Order o JOIN o.lineItems l
WHERE l.shipped = FALSE
----

Find all orders in which the shipping address
differs from the billing address. This example assumes that the
application developer uses two distinct _entity_ types to designate
shipping and billing addresses.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT o
FROM Order o
WHERE
    NOT (o.shippingAddress.state = o.billingAddress.state AND
         o.shippingAddress.city = o.billingAddress.city AND
         o.shippingAddress.street = o.billingAddress.street)
----

If the application developer uses a single
_entity_ type in two different relationships for both the shipping
address and the billing address, the above expression can be simplified
based on the equality rules defined in <<a5735>>. The
query can then be written as:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT o
FROM Order o
WHERE o.shippingAddress <> o.billingAddress
----

The query checks whether the same entity
abstract schema type instance (identified by its primary key) is related
to an order through two distinct relationships.

==== Queries Using Input Parameters

The following query finds the orders for a
product whose name is designated by an input parameter:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT o
FROM Order o JOIN o.lineItems l
WHERE l.product.name = ?1
----

For this query, the input parameter must be
of the type of the state field name, i.e., a string.

=== BNF

BNF notation summary:

* { ... } grouping
* [ ... ] optional constructs
* * zero or more
* + one or more
* | alternates

The following is the BNF for the Jakarta Persistence query language.

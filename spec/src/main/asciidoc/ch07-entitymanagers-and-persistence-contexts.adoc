== Entity Managers and Persistence Contexts [[a11431]]

=== Persistence Contexts [[a11432]]

A persistence context is a set of managed
entity instances in which for any persistent entity identity there is a
unique entity instance. Within the persistence context, the entity
instances and their lifecycle are managed by the entity manager.

In Jakarta EE environments, a JTA transaction
typically involves calls across multiple components. Such components may
often need to access the same persistence context within a single
transaction. To facilitate such use of entity managers in Jakarta EE
environments, when an entity manager is injected into a component or
looked up directly in the JNDI naming context, its persistence context
will automatically be propagated with the current JTA transaction, and
the `EntityManager` references that are mapped to the same persistence
unit will provide access to this same persistence context within the JTA
transaction. This propagation of persistence contexts by the Jakarta EE
container avoids the need for the application to pass references to
`EntityManager` instances from one component to another. An entity manager
for which the container manages the persistence context in this manner
is termed a _container-managed entity manager_. A container-managed
entity manager's lifecycle is managed by the Jakarta EE container.

In less common use cases within Jakarta EE
environments, applications may need to access a persistence context that
is “stand-alone”—i.e. not propagated along with the JTA transaction
across the `EntityManager` references for the given persistence unit.
Instead, each instance of creating an entity manager causes a new
isolated persistence context to be created that is not accessible
through other `EntityManager` references within the same transaction.
These use cases are supported through the `createEntityManager` methods
of the `EntityManagerFactory` interface. An entity manager that is used
by the application to create and destroy a persistence context in this
manner is termed an _application-managed entity manager_. An
application-managed entity manager's lifecycle is managed by the
application.

Both container-managed entity managers and
application-managed entity managers and their persistence contexts are
required to be supported in Jakarta EE web containers and EJB containers.
Within an EJB environment, container-managed entity managers are
typically used.

In Java SE environments and in Jakarta EE
application client containers, only application-managed entity managers
are required to be footnote:[Note that the use of
JTA is not required to be supported in application client containers.].

=== Obtaining an EntityManager

The entity manager for a persistence context
is obtained from an entity manager factory.

When container-managed entity managers are
used (in Jakarta EE environments), the application does not interact with
the entity manager factory. The entity managers are obtained directly
through dependency injection or from JNDI, and the container manages
interaction with the entity manager factory transparently to the
application.

When application-managed entity managers are
used, the application must use the entity manager factory to manage the
entity manager and persistence context lifecycle.

An entity manager must not be shared among
multiple concurrently executing threads, as the entity manager and
persistence context are not required to be threadsafe. Entity managers
must only be accessed in a single-threaded manner.

==== Obtaining an Entity Manager in the Jakarta EE Environment

A container-managed entity manager is
obtained by the application through dependency injection or through
direct lookup of the entity manager in the JNDI namespace. The container
manages the persistence context lifecycle and the creation and the
closing of the entity manager instance transparently to the application.

The `PersistenceContext` annotation is used
for entity manager injection. The `type` element specifies whether a
transaction-scoped or extended persistence context is to be used, as
described in <<a11791>>. The `synchronization` element specifies whether
the persistence context is always automatically joined to the current
transaction (the default) or is not joined to the current transaction
unless the `joinTransaction` method is invoked by the application. The
`unitName` element may optionally be specified to designate the
persistence unit whose entity manager factory is used by the container.
The semantics of the persistence context synchronization type are
further described in <<a11797>>. Section <<a13887>> provides further
information about the `unitName` element.

For example,

[source,java]
----
@PersistenceContext
EntityManager em;

@PersistenceContext(type=PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED)
EntityManager orderEM;
----

The JNDI lookup of an entity manager is illustrated below:

[source,java]
----
@Stateless
@PersistenceContext(name="OrderEM")
public class MySessionBean implements MyInterface {
    @Resource
    SessionContext ctx;

    public void doSomething() {
        EntityManager em = (EntityManager)ctx.lookup("OrderEM");

        // ...
    }
}
----

==== Obtaining an Application-managed Entity Manager or Entity Agent [[a11465]]

An application-managed entity manager or entity agent is obtained by the
application from an entity manager factory.

The `EntityManagerFactory` API used to obtain an application-managed entity
manager or entity agent is the same, independently of whether this API is
used in Jakarta EE or Java SE environments.

=== Obtaining an Entity Manager Factory

The `EntityManagerFactory` interface is used by the application to create
an application-managed entity manager or entity agentfootnote:[It may also
be used internally by the Jakarta EE container. See <<a12100>>.].

Every entity manager obtained from a given `EntityManagerFactory` is
configured in the same manner--connecting to the same database, using the
same initial settings as defined by the implementation, and so on.

More than one entity manager factory instance may be available simultaneously
in the JVM.footnote:[This is usually the case when the application uses more
than one database, since it's typical that each entity manager communicates
which exactly one database. On the other hand, there's usually only one entity
manager factory for each persistence unit.]

Methods of the `EntityManagerFactory` interface are threadsafe.

==== Obtaining an Entity Manager Factory in a Jakarta EE Container

Within a Jakarta EE environment, an entity
manager factory can be injected using the `PersistenceUnit` annotation
or obtained through JNDI lookup. The `unitName` element may optionally
be specified to designate the persistence unit whose entity manager
factory is used. (See <<a13887>>).

For example,

[source,java]
----
@PersistenceUnit
EntityManagerFactory emf;
----

==== Obtaining an Entity Manager Factory in a Java SE Environment

Outside a Jakarta EE container environment, the
`jakarta.persistence.Persistence` class is the bootstrap class that
provides access to an entity manager factory. The application creates an
entity manager factory by calling the `createEntityManagerFactory`
method of the `jakarta.persistence.Persistence` class, described in
<<a13443>>.

For example,

[source,java]
----
EntityManagerFactory emf =
    jakarta.persistence.Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("Order");
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
----

==== Obtaining an Entity Manager Factory for a programmatically-defined persistence unit

The class `jakarta.persistence.PersistenceConfiguration` described
in <<a13444>> may be used to programmatically define and configure a
persistence unit (see <<a12235>>), as an alternative to packaging a
`persistence.xml` file, mapping files, and classes inside an archive
as described in <<a12236>>.

An `EntityManagerFactory` may be obtained directly from the
`PersistenceConfiguration`.

For example,

[source,java]
----
DataSource datasource = (DataSource)
        new InitialContext()
                .lookup("java:global/jdbc/MyOrderDB");
EntityManagerFactory emf =
        new PersistenceConfiguration()
                .name("OrderManagement")
                .jtaDataSource(datasource)
                .mappingFile("ormap.xml")
                .managedClass(Order.class)
                .managedClass(Customer.class)
                .createEntityManagerFactory();
----

=== EntityManagerFactory Interface

The `EntityManagerFactory` interface found in <<_entitymanagerfactory_>>

An `EntityManagerFactory` may be used
by the application to obtain an application-managed entity manager. When
the application has finished using the entity manager factory, and/or at
application shutdown, the application should close the entity manager
factory. Once an entity manager factory has been closed, all its entity
managers are considered to be in the closed state.

An `EntityManagerFactory` also provides
access to information and services that are global to the persistence
unit. This includes access to the second level cache that is maintained
by the persistence provider and to the `PersistenceUnitUtil` interface.
The `Cache` interface is described in <<a12124>>; the
`PersistenceUnitUtil` interface in <<a12177>>.

Any number of vendor-specific properties may
be included in the map passed to the `createEntityManager` methods.
Properties that are not recognized by a vendor must be ignored.

Note that the policies of the installation
environment may restrict some information from being made available
through the `EntityManagerFactory` `getProperties` method (for example,
JDBC user, password, URL).

Vendors should use vendor namespaces for
properties (e.g., `com.acme.persistence.logging`). Entries that make
use of the namespace `jakarta.persistence` and its subnamespaces must not
be used for vendor-specific information. The namespace
`jakarta.persistence` is reserved for use by this specification.

=== Controlling Transactions

Every entity manager factory is defined to be of a given transactional
type--either JTA or resource-local--at the time it is configured and
created. See sections <<a12296>> and <<a12802>>.

Depending on the transactional type of the entity manager factory,
transactions involving `EntityManager` or `EntityAgent` operations may
be controlled either through JTA or through use of the resource-local
`EntityTransaction` API.

- An entity manager or entity agent whose underlying transactions are
  controlled through JTA is termed a _JTA entity manager or agent_.
  A JTA entity manager participates in the current JTA transaction,
  which is begun and committed externally to the entity manager and
  propagated to the underlying resource manager.

- An entity manager or entity agent whose underlying transactions are
  controlled by the application through the `EntityTransaction` API is
  termed a _resource-local entity manager or agent_. A resource-local
  transaction is mapped to a transaction over the underlying resource
  by the persistence provider. Resource-local entity managers may use
  server or local resources to connect to the database and are unaware
  of the presence of JTA transactions that may or may not be active.

A container-managed entity manager or entity agent must be a JTA entity
manager or agent. An application-managed entity manager or entity agent
may be of either transactional type, depending on the transactional type
of its entity manager factory.

[NOTE]
JTA entity managers and entity agents are only specified for use in Jakarta
EE containers. This specification does not address the use of JTA outside
the Jakarta EE environment.

Both JTA entity managers and resource-local entity managers are required to
be supported in Jakarta EE web containers and EJB containers. Within an EJB
environment, a JTA entity manager is typically used. In general, in Java SE
environments only resource-local entity managers are supported.

==== The EntityTransaction Interface

The `EntityTransaction` interface found in <<_entitytransaction_>>
is used to control resource transactions on resource-local entity
managers. The `getTransaction()` method of `EntityHandler` returns
an instance of the `EntityTransaction` interface.

When a resource-local entity manager is used,
and the persistence provider runtime throws an exception defined to
cause transaction rollback, the persistence provider must mark the
transaction for rollback.

If the `EntityTransaction.commit` operation
fails, the persistence provider must roll back the transaction.

The following example illustrates the
creation of an entity manager factory in a Java SE environment, and its
use in creating and using a resource-local entity manager.

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.persistence.*;

public class PasswordChanger {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        EntityManagerFactory emf =
            Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("Order");
        EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
        em.getTransaction().begin();

        User user = em.createQuery
            ("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.name=:name AND u.pass=:pass", User.class)
            .setParameter("name", args[0])
            .setParameter("pass", args[1])
            .getSingleResult();

        user.setPassword(args[2]);

        em.getTransaction().commit();
        em.close();
        emf.close();
    }
}
----

=== The runInTransaction and callInTransaction methods

The `runInTransaction` and `callInTransaction` methods of the
`EntityManagerFactory` provide a shortcut for persistence context
and transaction management with an application-managed `EntityManager`.

[source,java]
----
entityManagerFactory.runInTransaction(entityManager -> {
    User user = entityManager.createQuery
        ("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.name=:name AND u.pass=:pass", User.class)
        .setParameter("name", args[0])
        .setParameter("pass", args[1])
        .getSingleResult();

    user.setPassword(args[2]);
})
----

The argument function passed to `runInTransaction` or
`callInTransaction` must be called and passed a new instance of
`EntityManager`. When the argument function returns or throws an
exception, this `EntityManager` must be closed before `runInTransaction`
or `callInTransaction` returns.

The argument function is executed in the context of a transaction
associated with this new `EntityManager`.

- If the transaction type of the persistence unit is JTA, and there
  is a JTA transaction already associated with the caller, then the
  `EntityManager` is associated with this current transaction. If the
  argument function throws an exception, the JTA transaction must be
  marked for rollback, and the exception must be rethrown by
  `runInTransaction` or `callInTransaction`.  Otherwise,
  `callInTransaction` must return the same value returned by the
  argument function.

- Otherwise, if the transaction type of the persistence unit is
  resource-local, or if there is no JTA transaction already associated
  with the caller, then the `EntityManager` is associated with a new
  transaction. If the argument function throws an exception, this
  transaction must be rolled back, and then the exception must be
  rethrown by `runInTransaction` or `callInTransaction`. If the argument
  function returns, then `runInTransaction` or `callInTransaction` must
  attempt to commit the transaction. If the attempt to commit the
  transaction fails, the exception must be rethrown. Otherwise,
  `callInTransaction` must return the same value returned by the argument
  function.

The application should not attempt to manage the lifecycle of the
transaction or `EntityManager` directly. If the application calls an
operation of `EntityTransaction` from within a call to `runInTransaction`
or `callInTransaction`, the behavior is undefined.

=== The runWithAgent and callWithAgent methods

The `runWithAgent` and `callWithAgent` methods of the
`EntityManagerFactory` provide a shortcut for persistence context
and transaction management with an application-managed `EntityAgent`.

[source,java]
----
List<Permission> user =
    entityManagerFactory.callWithAgent(entityAgent ->
        entityAgent.createQuery
            ("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.name=:name AND u.pass=:pass", User.class)
            .setParameter("name", args[0])
            .setParameter("pass", args[1])
            .getSingleResult()
            .getPermissions());
----

The argument function passed to `runWithAgent` or
`callWithAgent` must be called and passed a new instance of
`EntityAgent`. When the argument function returns or throws an
exception, this `EntityAgent` must be closed before `runInTransaction`
or `callInTransaction` returns.

The argument function is executed in the context of a transaction
associated with this new `EntityAgent`.

- If the transaction type of the persistence unit is JTA, and there
  is a JTA transaction already associated with the caller, then the
  `EntityAgent` is associated with this current transaction. If the
  argument function throws an exception, the JTA transaction must be
  marked for rollback, and the exception must be rethrown by
  `runWithAgent` or `callWithAgent`.  Otherwise, `callWithAgent`
  must return the same value returned by the argument function.

- Otherwise, if the transaction type of the persistence unit is
  resource-local, or if there is no JTA transaction already associated
  with the caller, then the `EntityAgent` is associated with a new
  transaction. If the argument function throws an exception, this
  transaction must be rolled back, and then the exception must be
  rethrown by `runWithAgent` or `callWithAgent`. If the argument
  function returns, then `runWithAgent` or `callWithAgent` must
  attempt to commit the transaction. If the attempt to commit the
  transaction fails, the exception must be rethrown. Otherwise,
  `callWithAgent` must return the same value returned by the argument
  function.

The application should not attempt to manage the lifecycle of the
transaction or `EntityAgent` directly. If the application calls an
operation of `EntityTransaction` from within a call to `runWithAgent`
or `callWithAgent`, the behavior is undefined.

=== Container-managed Persistence Contexts [[a11791]]

When a container-managed entity manager is
used, the lifecycle of the persistence context is always managed
automatically, transparently to the application, and the persistence
context is propagated with the JTA transaction.

A container-managed persistence context may
be defined to have either a lifetime that is scoped to a single
transaction or an extended lifetime that spans multiple transactions,
depending on the `PersistenceContextType` that is specified when its
entity manager is created. This specification refers to such persistence
contexts as _transaction-scoped persistence contexts_ and _extended
persistence contexts_ respectively.

The lifetime of the persistence context is
declared using the `PersistenceContext` annotation or the
`persistence-context-ref` deployment descriptor element. By default, a
transaction-scoped persistence context is used.

Sections <<a11805>> and <<a11810>> describe transaction-scoped and extended persistence contexts
in the absence of persistence context propagation. Persistence context
propagation is described in <<a11816>>.

Persistence contexts are always associated
with an entity manager factory. In the following sections, “the
persistence context” should be understood to mean “the persistence
context associated with a particular entity manager factory”.

==== Persistence Context Synchronization Type [[a11797]]

By default, a container-managed persistence
context is of type `SynchronizationType.SYNCHRONIZED`. Such a
persistence context is automatically joined to the current JTA
transaction, and updates made to the persistence context are propagated
to the underlying resource manager.

A container-managed persistence context may
be specified to be of type `SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED`. A
persistence context of type `SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED` is not
enlisted in any JTA transaction unless explicitly joined to that
transaction by the application. A persistence context of type
`SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED` is enlisted in a JTA transaction
and registered for subsequent transaction notifications against that
transaction by the invocation of the `EntityManager` `joinTransaction`
method. The persistence context remains joined to the transaction until
the transaction commits or rolls back. After the transaction commits or
rolls back, the persistence context will not be joined to any subsequent
transaction unless the `joinTransaction` method is invoked in the scope
of that subsequent transaction.

A persistence context of type
`SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED` must not be flushed to the database
unless it is joined to a transaction. The application's use of queries
with pessimistic locks, bulk update or delete queries, etc. result in
the provider throwing the `TransactionRequiredException`. After the
persistence context has been joined to the JTA transaction, these
operations are again allowed.

The application is permitted to invoke the
persist, merge, remove, and refresh entity lifecycle operations on an
entity manager of type `SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED` independent
of whether the persistence context is joined to the current transaction.
After the persistence context has been joined to a transaction, changes
in a persistence context can be flushed to the database either
explicitly by the application or by the provider. If the `flush` method
is not explicitly invoked, the persistence provider may defer flushing
until commit time depending on the operations invoked and the flush mode
setting in effect.

If an extended persistence context of type
`SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED` has not been joined to the current
JTA transaction, rollback of the JTA transaction will have no effect
upon the persistence context. In general, it is recommended that a
non-JTA datasource be specified for use by the persistence provider for
a persistence context of type `SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED` that
has not been joined to a JTA transaction in order to alleviate the risk
of integrating uncommitted changes into the persistence context in the
event that the transaction is later rolled back.

If a persistence context of type
`SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED` has been joined to the JTA
transaction, transaction rollback will cause the persistence context to
be cleared and all pre-existing managed and removed instances to become
detached. (See <<a2049>>.)

When a JTA transaction exists, a persistence
context of type `SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED` is propagated with
that transaction according to the rules in <<a11820>> regardless of whether the persistence context has been
joined to that transaction.

==== Container-managed Transaction-scoped Persistence Context [[a11805]]

The application can obtain a
container-managed entity manager with transaction-scoped persistence
context by injection or direct lookup in the JNDI namespace. The
persistence context type for the entity manager is defaulted or defined
as `PersistenceContextType.TRANSACTION`.

A new persistence context begins when the
container-managed entity manager is invokedfootnote:[Specifically, when
one of the methods of the `EntityManager` interface is invoked.] in
the scope of an active JTA transaction, and there is no current
persistence context already associated with the JTA transaction. The
persistence context is created and then associated with the JTA
transaction. This association of the persistence context with the JTA
transaction is independent of the synchronization type of the
persistence context and whether the persistence context has been joined
to the transaction.

The persistence context ends when the
associated JTA transaction commits or rolls back, and all entities that
were managed by the `EntityManager` become detached.footnote:[Note that this
applies to a transaction-scoped persistence context of type
SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED that has not been joined to the
transaction as well.]

If the entity manager is invoked outside the
scope of a transaction, any entities loaded from the database will
immediately become detached at the end of the method call.

==== Container-managed Extended Persistence Context [[a11810]]

A container-managed extended persistence
context can only be initiated within the scope of a stateful session
bean. It exists from the point at which the stateful session bean that
declares a dependency on an entity manager of type
`PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED` is created, and is said to be `bound`
to the stateful session bean. The dependency on the extended persistence
context is declared by means of the `PersistenceContext` annotation or
`persistence-context-ref` deployment descriptor element. The association
of the extended persistence context with the JTA transaction is
independent of the synchronization type of the persistence context and
whether the persistence context has been joined to the transaction.

The persistence context is closed by the
container when the `@Remove` method of the stateful session bean
completes (or the stateful session bean instance is otherwise
destroyed).

===== Inheritance of Extended Persistence Context

If a stateful session bean instantiates a
stateful session bean (executing in the same EJB container instance)
which also has such an extended persistence context with the same
synchronization type, the extended persistence context of the first
stateful session bean is inherited by the second stateful session bean
and bound to it, and this rule recursively applies—independently of
whether transactions are active or not at the point of the creation of
the stateful session beans. If the stateful session beans differ in
declared synchronization type, the EJBException is thrown by the
container.

If the persistence context has been inherited
by any stateful session beans, the container does not close the
persistence context until all such stateful session beans have been
removed or otherwise destroyed.

==== Persistence Context Propagation [[a11816]]

As described in <<a11432>>, a single
persistence context may correspond to one or more JTA entity manager
instances (all associated with the same entity manager
factoryfootnote:[Entity manager
instances obtained from different entity manager factories never share
the same persistence context.]).

The persistence context is propagated across
the entity manager instances as the JTA transaction is propagated. A
persistence context of type `SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED` is
propagated with the JTA transaction regardless of whether it has been
joined to the transaction.

Propagation of persistence contexts only
applies within a local environment. Persistence contexts are not
propagated to remote tiers.

===== Requirements for Persistence Context Propagation [[a11820]]

Persistence contexts are propagated by the
container across component invocations as follows.

If a component is called and there is no JTA
transaction or the JTA transaction is not propagated, the persistence
context is not propagated.

* If an entity manager is then invoked from
within the component:
** Invocation of an entity manager defined with
`PersistenceContextType.TRANSACTION` will result in use of a new
persistence context (as described in <<a11805>>).
** Invocation of an entity manager defined with
`PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED` will result in the use of the existing
extended persistence context bound to that component.
** If the entity manager is invoked within a JTA
transaction, the persistence context will be associated with the JTA
transaction.

If a component is called and the JTA
transaction is propagated into that component:

* If the component is a stateful session bean
to which an extended persistence context has been bound and there is a
different persistence context associated with the JTA transaction, an
`EJBException` is thrown by the container.
* If there is a persistence context of type
`SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED` associated with the JTA transaction
and the target component specifies a persistence context of type
`SynchronizationType.SYNCHRONIZED`, the `IllegalStateException` is
thrown by the container.
* Otherwise, if there is a persistence context
associated with the JTA transaction, that persistence context is
propagated and used.

[NOTE]
====
Note that a component with a persistence
context of type `SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED` may be called by a
component propagating either a persistence context of type
`SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED` or a persistence context of type
`SynchronizationType.SYNCHRONIZED` into it.
====

The following example shows a container-managed, transaction-scoped
persistence context:

[source,java]
----
@Stateless
public class ShoppingCartImpl implements ShoppingCart {
    @PersistenceContext
    EntityManager em;

    public Order getOrder(Long id) {
        Order order = em.find(Order.class, id);
        order.getLineItems();
        return order;
    }

    public Product getProduct(String name) {
        return (Product) em.createQuery("select p from Product p where p.name = : name")
               .setParameter("name", name)
               .getSingleResult();
    }

    public LineItem createLineItem(Order order, Product product, int quantity) {
        LineItem li = new LineItem(order, product, quantity);
        order.getLineItems().add(li);
        em.persist(li);
        return li;
    }
}
----

This example shows a container-managed extended persistence context:

[source,java]
----
/*
 * An extended transaction context is used. The entities remain
 * managed in the persistence context across multiple transactions.
 */
@Stateful
@Transaction(REQUIRES_NEW)
public class ShoppingCartImpl implements ShoppingCart {
    @PersistenceContext(type = EXTENDED)
    EntityManager em;

    private Order order;
    private Product product;

    public void initOrder(Long id) {
        order = em.find(Order.class, id);
    }

    public void initProduct(String name) {
        product = (Product) em.createQuery("select p from Product p where p.name = : name")
                  .setParameter("name", name)
                  .getSingleResult();
    }

    public LineItem createLineItem(int quantity) {
        LineItem li = new LineItem(order, product, quantity);
        order.getLineItems().add(li);
        em.persist(li);
        return li;
    }
}
----

=== Application-managed Persistence Contexts [[a11894]]

When an application-managed entity manager is
used, the application interacts directly with the persistence provider's
entity manager factory to manage the entity manager lifecycle and to
obtain and destroy persistence contexts.

All such application-managed persistence
contexts are extended in scope, and can span multiple transactions.

The `EntityManagerFactory` .
`createEntityManager` method and the `EntityManager` `close` and
`isOpen` methods are used to manage the lifecycle of an
application-managed entity manager and its associated persistence
context.

The extended persistence context exists from
the point at which the entity manager has been created using
`EntityManagerFactory.createEntityManager` until the entity manager is
closed by means of `EntityManager.close`.

An extended persistence context obtained from
the application-managed entity manager is a stand-alone persistence
context—it is not propagated with the transaction.

When a JTA application-managed entity manager
is used, an application-managed persistence context may be specified to
be of type `SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED`. A persistence context
of type `SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED` is not enlisted in any JTA
transaction unless explicitly joined to that transaction by the
application. A persistence context of type
`SynchronizationType.UNSYNCHRONIZED` is enlisted in a JTA transaction
and registered for subsequent transaction notifications against that
transaction by the invocation of the `EntityManager` `joinTransaction`
method. The persistence context remains joined to the transaction until
the transaction commits or rolls back. After the transaction commits or
rolls back, the persistence context will not be joined to any subsequent
transaction unless the `joinTransaction` method is invoked in the scope
of that subsequent transaction.

When a JTA application-managed entity manager
is used, if the entity manager is created outside the scope of the
current JTA transaction, it is the responsibility of the application to
join the entity manager to the transaction (if desired) by calling
`EntityManager.joinTransaction`. If the entity manager is created
outside the scope of a JTA transaction, it is not joined to the
transaction unless `EntityManager.joinTransaction` is called.

The `EntityManager.close` method closes an
entity manager to release its persistence context and other resources.
After calling `close`, the application must not invoke any further
methods on the `EntityManager` instance except for `getTransaction` and
`isOpen`, or the `IllegalStateException` will be thrown. If the `close`
method is invoked when a transaction is active, the persistence context
remains managed until the transaction completes.

The `EntityManager.isOpen` method indicates
whether the entity manager is open. The `isOpen` method returns true
until the entity manager has been closed.

This example shows an application-managed persistence context used in
a stateless session bean:

=== Requirements on the Container

==== Application-managed Persistence Contexts

When application-managed persistence contexts
are used, the container must instantiate the entity manager factory and
expose it to the application via JNDI. The container might use internal
APIs to create the entity manager factory, or it might use the
`PersistenceProvider.createContainerEntityManagerFactory` method.
However, the container is required to support third-party persistence
providers, and in this case the container must use the
`PersistenceProvider.createContainerEntityManagerFactory` method to
create the entity manager factory and the `EntityManagerFactory.close`
method to destroy the entity manager factory prior to shutdown (if it
has not been previously closed by the application).

==== Container Managed Persistence Contexts

The container is responsible for managing the
lifecycle of container-managed persistence contexts, for injecting
`EntityManager` references into web components and session bean and
message-driven bean components, and for making `EntityManager`
references available to direct lookups in JNDI.

When operating with a third-party persistence
provider, the container uses the contracts defined in <<a12100>>
to create and destroy container-managed
persistence contexts. It is undefined whether a new entity manager
instance is created for every persistence context, or whether entity
manager instances are sometimes reused. Exactly how the container
maintains the association between persistence context and JTA
transaction is not defined.

If a persistence context is already
associated with a JTA transaction, the container uses that persistence
context for subsequent invocations within the scope of that transaction,
according to the semantics for persistence context propagation defined
in <<a11816>>.

=== Runtime Contracts between the Container and Persistence Provider [[a12100]]

This section describes contracts
between the container and the persistence provider for the pluggability
of third-party persistence providers. Containers are required to support
these pluggability contracts.footnote:[It is not required
that these contracts be used when a third-party persistence provider is
not used: the container might use these same APIs or its might use its
own internal APIs.]

==== Container Responsibilities

For the management of a transaction-scoped
persistence context, if there is no EntityManager already associated
with the JTA transaction:

* The container creates a new entity manager by
calling `EntityManagerFactory.createEntityManager` when the first
invocation of an entity manager with
`PersistenceContextType.TRANSACTION` occurs within the scope of a
business method executing in the JTA transaction.
* After the JTA transaction has completed
(either by transaction commit or rollback), the container closes the
entity manager by calling `EntityManager.close`.
footnote:[The container may
choose to pool EntityManagers: it instead of creating and closing in
each case, it may acquire one from its pool and call `clear()` on it.]
Note that the JTA transaction may rollback in a
background thread (e.g., as a result of transaction timeout), in which
case the container should arrange for the entity manager to be closed
but the `EntityManager.close` method should not be concurrently invoked
while the application is in an `EntityManager` invocation.

The container must throw the
`TransactionRequiredException` if a transaction-scoped persistence
context is used and the `EntityManager` `persist`, `remove`, `merge`,
or `refresh` method is invoked when no transaction is active.

For stateful session beans with extended
persistence contexts:

* The container creates an entity manager by
calling `EntityManagerFactory.createEntityManager` when a stateful
session bean is created that declares a dependency on an entity manager
with `PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED`. (See <<a11810>>).
* The container closes the entity manager by
calling `EntityManager.close` after the stateful session bean and all
other stateful session beans that have inherited the same persistence
context as the entity manager have been removed.
* When a business method of the stateful
session bean is invoked, if the stateful session bean uses container
managed transaction demarcation, and the entity manager is not already
associated with the current JTA transaction, the container associates
the entity manager with the current JTA transaction and, if the
persistence context is of type `SynchronizationType.SYNCHRONIZED`, the
container calls `EntityManager.joinTransaction`. If there is a
different persistence context already associated with the JTA
transaction, the container throws the `EJBException`.
* When a business method of the stateful
session bean is invoked, if the stateful session bean uses bean managed
transaction demarcation and a UserTransaction is begun within the
method, the container associates the persistence context with the JTA
transaction and, if the persistence context is of type
`SynchronizationType.SYNCHRONIZED`, the container calls
`EntityManager.joinTransaction`.

The container must throw the
`IllegalStateException` if the application calls `EntityManager.close`
on a container-managed entity manager.

When the container creates an entity manager,
it may pass a map of properties to the persistence provider by using the
`EntityManagerFactory.createEntityManager(Map map)` method. If
properties have been specified in the `PersistenceContext` annotation or
the `persistence-context-ref` deployment descriptor element, this method
must be used and the map must include the specified properties.

If the application invokes
`EntityManager.unwrap(Class<T> cls)`, and the container cannot satisfy
the request, the container must delegate the `unwrap` invocation to the
provider's entity manager instance.

==== Provider Responsibilities

The Provider has no knowledge of the
distinction between transaction-scoped and extended persistence
contexts. It provides entity managers to the container when requested
and registers for transaction synchronization notifications.

* When
`EntityManagerFactory.createEntityManager` is invoked, the provider must
create and return a new entity manager. If a JTA transaction is active
and the persistence context is of type
`SynchronizationType.SYNCHRONIZED`, the provider must register for
synchronization notifications against the JTA transaction.
* When `EntityManager.joinTransaction` is
invoked, the provider must register for synchronization notifications
against the current JTA transaction if a previous `joinTransaction`
invocation for the transaction has not already been processed.
* When the JTA transaction commits, if the
persistence context is of type `SynchronizationType.SYNCHRONIZED` or has
otherwise been joined to the transaction, the provider must flush all
modified entity state to the database.
* When the JTA transaction rolls back, the
provider must detach all managed entities if the persistence context is
of type `SynchronizationType.SYNCHRONIZED` or has otherwise been joined
to the transaction. Note that the JTA transaction may rollback in a
background thread (e.g., as a result of transaction timeout), in which
case the provider should arrange for the managed entities to be detached
from the persistence context but not concurrently while the application
is in an `EntityManager` invocation.
* When the provider throws an exception defined
to cause transaction rollback, the provider must mark the transaction
for rollback if the persistence context is of type
`SynchronizationType.SYNCHRONIZED` or has otherwise been joined to the
transaction.
* When `EntityManager.close` is invoked, the
provider should release all resources that it may have allocated after
any outstanding transactions involving the entity manager have
completed. If the entity manager was already in a closed state, the
provider must throw the `IllegalStateException`.
* When `EntityManager.clear` is invoked, the
provider must detach all managed entities.

=== PersistenceUnitUtil Interface [[a12177]]

The `PersistenceUnitUtil` interface found in <<_persistenceunitutil_>>
declares utility methods that can be invoked on entities associated
with the persistence unit. The behavior is undefined if these methods
are invoked on an entity instance that is not associated with the
persistence unit from whose entity manager factory this interface has
been obtained.

=== SchemaManager Interface [[a12178]]

The `SchemaManager` interface may be found in <<_schemamanager_>>.
An instance of `SchemaManager` may be obtained by calling the
`getSchemaManager()` method of `EntityManagerFactory`.

The `SchemaManager` interface allows programmatic control over schema
generation and cleanup at runtime. This differs from the functionality
described in <<a12917>> which allows schema generation before or during
the application deployment and initialization process. Similarly, the
`generateSchema` method described in <<a12803>> is intended to be called
before the `EntityManagerFactory` is available. By contrast, an instance
of `SchemaManager` is only available after an `EntityManagerFactory` has
already been created.

For example, `SchemaManager` is especially useful in tests.

The methods of `SchemaManager` correspond to values of the property
`jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.action`. The methods
`create()`, `drop()`, and `validate()` correspond to the actions
`create`, `drop`, and `validate`. The method `truncate()` has no
corresponding action.

Thus, the behavior of the `SchemaManager` may be controlled via the
properties defined in <<a12917>> and <<a12384>>.

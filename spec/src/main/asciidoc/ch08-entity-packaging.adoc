== Entity Packaging [[a12229]]

This chapter describes the packaging of
persistence units.

=== Persistence Unit [[a12235]]

A persistence unit is a logical grouping that
includes:

* An entity manager factory and its entity
managers, together with their configuration information.
* The set of managed classes included in the
persistence unit and managed by the entity managers of the entity
manager factory.
* Mapping metadata (in the form of metadata
annotations and/or XML metadata) that specifies the mapping of the
classes to the database.

=== Persistence Unit Packaging [[a12236]]

Within Jakarta EE environments, an EJB-JAR, WAR,
EAR, or application client JAR can define a persistence unit. Any number
of persistence units may be defined within these scopes.

A persistence unit may be packaged within one
or more jar files contained within a WAR or EAR, as a set of classes
within an EJB-JAR file or in the WAR _classes_ directory, or as a
combination of these as defined below.

A persistence unit is defined by a
_persistence.xml_ file. The jar file or directory whose _META-INF_
directory contains the _persistence.xml_ file is termed the _root_ of
the persistence unit. In Jakarta EE environments, the root of a persistence
unit must be one of the following:

* an EJB-JAR file
* the _WEB-INF/classes_ directory of a WAR filefootnote:[The root of the
persistence unit is the _WEB-INF/classes_ directory; the
_persistence.xml_ file is therefore contained in the
_WEB-INF/classes/META-INF_ directory.]
* a jar file in the _WEB-INF/lib_ directory of
* a WAR file
* a jar file in the EAR library directory
* an application client jar file

It is not required that an EJB-JAR or WAR
file containing a persistence unit be packaged in an EAR unless the
persistence unit contains persistence classes in addition to those
contained within the EJB-JAR or WAR. See <<a12305>>.

[NOTE]
====
Java Persistence 1.0 supported use of a
jar file in the root of the EAR as the root of a persistence unit. This
use is no longer supported. Portable applications should use the EAR
library directory for this case instead. See
<<a19499>>.
====

A persistence unit must have a name. Only one
persistence unit of any given name must be defined within a single
EJB-JAR file, within a single WAR file, within a single application
client jar, or within an EAR. See <<a12459>>.

The _persistence.xml_ file may be used to
designate more than one persistence unit within the same scope.

All persistence classes defined at the level
of the Jakarta EE EAR must be accessible to other Jakarta EE components in the
application—i.e. loaded by the application classloader—such that if the
same entity class is referenced by two different Jakarta EE components
(which may be using different persistence units), the referenced class
is the same identical class.

In Java SE environments, the metadata mapping
files, jar files, and classes described in the following sections can be
used. To insure the portability of a Java SE application, it is
necessary to explicitly list the managed persistence classes that are
included in the persistence unit using the _class_ element of the
_persistence.xml_ file. See <<a12305>>.

==== persistence.xml file [[a12237]]

A _persistence.xml_ file defines a
persistence unit. The _persistence.xml_ file is located in the
_META-INF_ directory of the root of the persistence unit. It may be used
to specify managed persistence classes included in the persistence unit,
object/relational mapping information for those classes, scripts for use
in schema generation and the bulk loading of data, and other
configuration information for the persistence unit and for the entity
manager(s) and entity manager factory for the persistence unit. This
information may be defined by containment or by reference, as described
below.

The object/relational mapping information can
take the form of annotations on the managed persistence classes included
in the persistence unit, an _orm.xml_ file contained in the _META-INF_
directory of the root of the persistence unit, one or more XML files on
the classpath and referenced from the _persistence.xml_ file, or a
combination of these.

The managed persistence classes may either be
contained within the root of the persistence unit; or they may be
specified by reference—i.e., by naming the classes, class archives, or
XML mapping files (which in turn reference classes) that are accessible
on the application classpath; or they may be specified by some
combination of these means. See <<a12305>>.

The root element of the _persistence.xml_
file is the _persistence_ element. The _persistence_ element consists of
one or more _persistence-unit_ elements.

The _persistence-unit_ element consists of
the _name_ and _transaction-type_ attributes and the following
sub-elements: _description_, _provider_, _jta-data-source_,
_non-jta-data-source_, _mapping-file_, _jar-file_, _class_,
_exclude-unlisted-classes_, _shared-cache-mode_, _validation-mode_,
and _properties_.

The _name_ attribute is required; the other
attributes and elements are optional. Their semantics are described in
the following subsections.

Examples:

[source,xml]
----
<persistence>
    <persistence-unit name="OrderManagement">
        <description>
            This unit manages orders and customers.
            It does not rely on any vendor-specific features and can
            therefore be deployed to any persistence provider.
        </description>
        <jta-data-source>jdbc/MyOrderDB</jta-data-source>
        <mapping-file>ormap.xml</mapping-file>
        <jar-file>MyOrderApp.jar</jar-file>
        <class>com.widgets.Order</class>
        <class>com.widgets.Customer</class>
    </persistence-unit>
</persistence>
----

[source,xml]
----
<persistence>
    <persistence-unit name="OrderManagement2">
        <description>
            This unit manages inventory for auto parts.
            It depends on features provided by the
            com.acme.persistence implementation.
        </description>
        <provider>com.acme.AcmePersistence</provider>
        <jta-data-source>jdbc/MyPartDB</jta-data-source>
        <mapping-file>ormap2.xml</mapping-file>
        <jar-file>MyPartsApp.jar</jar-file>
        <properties>
            <property name="com.acme.persistence.sql-logging" value="on"/>
        </properties>
    </persistence-unit>
</persistence>
----

===== name

The _name_ attribute defines the name for the
persistence unit. This name may be used to identify a persistence unit
referred to by the _PersistenceContext_ and _PersistenceUnit_
annotations and in the programmatic API for creating an entity manager
factory.

===== transaction-type [[a12296]]

The _transaction-type_ attribute is used to
specify whether the entity managers provided by the entity manager
factory for the persistence unit must be JTA entity managers or
resource-local entity managers. The value of this element is _JTA_ or
_RESOURCE_LOCAL_. A _transaction-type_ of _JTA_ assumes that a JTA data
source will be provided—either as specified by the _jta-data-source_
element or provided by the container. In general, in Jakarta EE
environments, a _transaction-type_ of _RESOURCE_LOCAL_ assumes that a
non-JTA datasource will be provided. In a Jakarta EE environment, if this
element is not specified, the default is _JTA_. In a Java SE
environment, if this element is not specified, the default is
_RESOURCE_LOCAL_.

===== description

The _description_ element provides optional
descriptive information about the persistence unit.

===== provider [[a12300]]

The _provider_ element specifies the name of
the persistence provider's _jakarta.persistence.spi.PersistenceProvider_
class. The _provider_ element is optional, but should be specified if
the application is dependent upon a particular persistence provider
being used.

===== jta-data-source, non-jta-data-source [[a12302]]

In Jakarta EE environments, the
_jta-data-source_ and _non-jta-data-source_ elements are used to specify
the JNDI name of the JTA and/or non-JTA data source to be used by the
persistence provider. If neither is specified, the deployer must specify
a JTA data source at deployment or the default JTA data source must be
provided by the container, and a JTA EntityManagerFactory will be
created to correspond to it.

In Java SE environments, these elements may
be used or the data source information may be specified by other
means—depending upon the requirements of the provider.

===== mapping-file, jar-file, class, exclude-unlisted-classes [[a12305]]

The following classes must be implicitly or
explicitly denoted as managed persistence classes to be included within
a persistence unit: entity classes; embeddable classes; mapped
superclasses; converter classes.

The set of managed persistence classes
that are managed by a persistence unit is defined by using one or more
of the following:footnote:[Note that an
individual class may be used in more than one persistence unit.]

* Annotated managed persistence classes
contained in the root of the persistence unit (unless the
_exclude-unlisted-classes_ element is specified)
* One or more object/relational mapping XML
files
* One or more jar files that will be searched
for classes
* An explicit list of classes

The set of entities managed by the
persistence unit is the union of these sources, with the mapping
metadata annotations (or annotation defaults) for any given class being
overridden by the XML mapping information file if there are both
annotations as well as XML mappings for that class. The minimum portable
level of overriding is at the level of the persistent field or property.

The classes and/or jars that are named as
part of a persistence unit must be on the classpath; referencing them
from the _persistence.xml_ file does not cause them to be placed on the
classpath.

All classes must be on the classpath to
ensure that entity managers from different persistence units that map
the same class will be accessing the same identical class.

====== Annotated Classes in the Root of the Persistence Unit

All classes contained in the root of the
persistence unit are searched for annotated managed persistence
classes—classes with the _Entity_, _Embeddable_, _MappedSuperclass_,
or _Converter_ annotation—and any mapping metadata annotations found on
these classes will be processed, or they will be mapped using the
mapping annotation defaults. If it is not intended that the annotated
persistence classes contained in the root of the persistence unit be
included in the persistence unit, the _exclude-unlisted-classes_ element
must be specified as _true_. The _exclude-unlisted-classes_ element is
not intended for use in Java SE environments.

====== Object/relational Mapping Files

An object/relational mapping XML file
contains mapping information for the classes listed in it.

An object/relational mapping XML file named
_orm.xml_ may be specified in the _META-INF_ directory in the root of
the persistence unit or in the _META-INF_ directory of any jar file
referenced by the _persistence.xml_. Alternatively, or in addition, one
or more mapping files may be referenced by the _mapping-file_ elements
of the _persistence-unit_ element. These mapping files may be present
anywhere on the class path.

An _orm.xml_ mapping file or other mapping
file is loaded as a resource by the persistence provider. If a mapping
file is specified, the classes and mapping information specified in the
mapping file will be used as described in <<a16944>>. If multiple mapping files are specified (possibly including
one or more _orm.xml_ files), the resulting mappings are obtained by
combining the mappings from all of the files. The result is undefined if
multiple mapping files (including any _orm.xml_ file) referenced within
a single persistence unit contain overlapping mapping information for
any given class. The object/relational mapping information contained in
any mapping file referenced within the persistence unit must be disjoint
at the class-level from object/relational mapping information contained
in any other such mapping file.

====== Jar Files

One or more JAR files may be specified
using the _jar-file_ elements instead of, or in addition to the mapping
files specified in the _mapping-file_ elements. If specified, these JAR
files will be searched for managed persistence classes, and any mapping
metadata annotations found on them will be processed, or they will be
mapped using the mapping annotation defaults defined by this
specification. Such JAR files are specified relative to the directory or
jar file that _contains_ the root of the
persistence unit.footnote:[Persistence providers
are encouraged to support this syntax for use in Java SE environments.]

The following examples illustrate the use of
the _jar-file_ element to reference additional persistence classes.
These examples use the convention that a jar file with a name
terminating in “ _PUnit_ ” contains the _persistence.xml_ file and that
a jar file with a name terminating in “ _Entities_ ” contains additional
persistence classes.

*Example 1:*

----
app.ear
    lib/earEntities.jar
    earRootPUnit.jar (with META-INF/persistence.xml)
----

_persistence.xml_ contains:

[source,xml]
----
<jar-file>lib/earEntities.jar</jar-file>
----

*Example 2:*

----
app.ear
    lib/earEntities.jar
    lib/earLibPUnit.jar (with META-INF/persistence.xml)

<jar-file>earEntities.jar</jar-file>
----

*Example 3:*

<jar-file>../../lib/earEntities.jar</jar-file>
----

*Example 7:*

----
app.ear
    lib/earEntities.jar
    war1.war

----

_persistence.xml_ contains:

[source,xml]
----
<jar-file>../../../lib/earEntities.jar</jar-file>
----

====== List of Managed Classes

A list of named managed persistence
classes—entity classes, embeddable classes, mapped superclasses, and
converter classes—may be specified instead of, or in addition to, the
JAR files and mapping files. Any mapping metadata annotations found on
these classes will be processed, or they will be mapped using the
mapping annotation defaults. The _class_ element is used to list a
managed persistence class.

A list of all named managed persistence
classes must be specified in Java SE environments to insure portability.
Portable Java SE applications should not rely on the other mechanisms
described here to specify the managed persistence classes of a
persistence unit. Persistence providers may require that the set of
entity classes and classes that are to be managed must be fully
enumerated in each of the _persistence.xml_ files in Java SE
environments.

===== shared-cache-mode [[a12380]]

The _shared-cache-mode_ element determines
whether second-level caching is in effect for the persistence unit. See
<<a3065>>.

===== validation-mode [[a12382]]

The _validation-mode_ element determines
whether automatic lifecycle event time validation is in effect. See
<<a2374>>.

===== properties [[a12384]]

The _properties_ element is used to specify
both standard and vendor-specific properties and hints that apply to the
persistence unit and its entity manager factory configuration.

The following properties and hints defined by
this specification are intended for use in both Jakarta EE and Java SE
environments:

* _jakarta.persistence.lock.timeout_ — value in
milliseconds for pessimistic lock timeout. This is a hint only.
* _jakarta.persistence.query.timeout_ — value in
milliseconds for query timeout. This is a hint only.
* _jakarta.persistence.defaultFetchType_ — specifies whether associations
mapped _fetch=DEFAULT_ should be treated as LAZY or EAGER (by default,
they are EAGER).
* _jakarta.persistence.validation.group.pre-persist_ — groups that are
targeted for validation upon the pre-persist event (overrides the
default behavior).
* _jakarta.persistence.validation.group.pre-update_ — groups that are
targeted for validation upon the pre-update event (overrides the default
behavior).
* _jakarta.persistence.validation.group.pre-remove_ — groups that are
targeted for validation upon the pre-remove event (overrides the default
behavior).

The following properties defined by this
specification are intended for use in Java SE environments.

* _jakarta.persistence.jdbc.driver_ — fully
qualified name of the driver class
* _jakarta.persistence.jdbc.url_ — driver-specific URL
* _jakarta.persistence.jdbc.user_ — username
used by database connection
* _jakarta.persistence.jdbc.password_ — password
for database connection validation

Scripts for use in schema generation may be
specified using the
_jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.create-script-source_ and
_jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.drop-script-source_ properties. A
script to specify SQL for the bulk loading of data may be specified by
the _jakarta.persistence.sql-load-script-source_ property. These
properties are intended for use in both Jakarta EE and Java SE
environments:

* _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.create-script-source_ — _name of a
script packaged as part of the persistence application or a string
corresponding to a file URL string that designates a script._
* _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.drop-script-source_ — _name of a
script packaged as part of the persistence application or a string
corresponding to a file URL string that designates a script._
* _jakarta.persistence.sql-load-script-source_ —
_name of a script packaged as part of the persistence unit or a string
corresponding to a file URL string that designates a script._

When scripts are packaged as part of the
persistence application, these properties must specify locations
relative to the root of the persistence unit. When scripts are provided
externally (or when schema generation is to occur into script files, as
described below), strings corresponding to file URLs must be specified.
In Jakarta EE environments, such file URL specifications must be absolute
paths (not relative). In Jakarta EE environments, all source and target
file locations must be accessible to the application server deploying
the persistence unit.

In general, it is expected that schema
generation will be initiated by means of the APIs described in
<<a12917>>. However, schema
generation actions may also be specified by means of the following
properties used in the _persistence.xml_ file.

* _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action_ +
The _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action_ property specifies
the action to be taken by the persistence provider with regard to the
database artifacts. The values for this property are _none_, _create_,
_drop-and-create_, _drop_, _validate_. If this property is not specified,
it is assumed that schema generation is not needed or will be initiated by
other means, and, by default, no schema generation actions will be taken
on the database. (See <<a12917>>.)
* _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.action_ +
The _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.action_ property specifies
which scripts are to be generated by the persistence provider. The
values for this property are _none_, _create_, _drop-and-create_,
_drop_. A script will only be generated if the script target is
specified. If this property is not specified, it is assumed that script
generation is not needed or will be initiated by other means, and, by
default, no scripts will be generated. (See <<a12917>>.)
* _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.create-source_ +
The _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.create-source_ property specifies
whether the creation of database artifacts is to occur on the basis of
the object/relational mapping metadata, DDL script, or a combination of
the two. The values for this property are _metadata_, _script_,
_metadata-then-script_, _script-then-metadata_. If this property is
not specified, and a script is specified by the
_jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.create-script-source_ property, the
script (only) will be used for schema generation; otherwise if this
property is not specified, schema generation will occur on the basis of
the object/relational mapping metadata (only). The
_metadata-then-script_ and _script-then-metadata_ values specify that a
combination of metadata and script is to be used and the order in which
this use is to occur. If either of these values is specified and the
resulting database actions are not disjoint, the results are undefined
and schema generation may fail.
* _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.drop-source_ +
The _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.drop-source_ property specifies
whether the dropping of database artifacts is to occur on the basis of
the object/relational mapping metadata, DDL script, or a combination of
the two. The values for this property are _metadata_, _script_,
_metadata-then-script_, _script-then-metadata_. If this property is
not specified, and a script is specified by the
_jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.drop-script-source_ property, the
script (only) will be used for the dropping of database artifacts;
otherwise if this property is not specified, the dropping of database
artifacts will occur on the basis of the object/relational mapping
metadata (only). The _metadata-then-script_ and _script-then-metadata_
values specify that a combination of metadata and script is to be used
and the order in which this use is to occur. If either of these values
is specified and the resulting database actions are not disjoint, the
results are undefined and the dropping of database artifacts may fail.
* _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.create-target_, +
_jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.drop-target_ +
If scripts are to be generated, the target
locations for the writing of these scripts must be specified. These
targets are specified as strings corresponding to file URLs.

If a persistence provider does not recognize
a property (other than a property defined by this specification), the
provider must ignore it.

Vendors should use vendor namespaces for
properties (e.g., _com.acme.persistence.logging_). Entries that make
use of the namespace _jakarta.persistence_ and its subnamespaces must not
be used for vendor-specific information. The namespace
_jakarta.persistence_ is reserved for use by this specification.

===== Examples

The following are sample contents of a _persistence.xml_ file.

*Example 1:*

[source,xml]
----
<persistence-unit name="OrderManagement"/>
----

A persistence unit named _OrderManagement_ is created.

Any annotated managed persistence classes
found in the root of the persistence unit are added to the list of
managed persistence classes. If a _META-INF/orm.xml_ file exists, any
classes referenced by it and mapping information contained in it are
used as specified above. Because no provider is specified, the
persistence unit is assumed to be portable across providers. Because the
transaction type is not specified, JTA is assumed for Jakarta EE
environments. The container must provide the data source (it may be
specified at application deployment, for example). In Java SE
environments, the data source may be specified by other means and a
transaction type of _RESOURCE_LOCAL_ is assumed.

*Example 2:*

[source,xml]
----
<persistence-unit name="OrderManagement2">
    <mapping-file>mappings.xml</mapping-file>
</persistence-unit>
----

A persistence unit named _OrderManagement2_
is created. Any annotated managed persistence classes found in the root
of the persistence unit are added to the list of managed persistence
classes. The _mappings.xml_ resource exists on the classpath and any
classes and mapping information contained in it are used as specified
above. If a _META-INF/orm.xml_ file exists, any classes and mapping
information contained in it are used as well. The transaction type, data
source, and provider are as described above.

*Example 3:*

[source,xml]
----
<persistence-unit name="OrderManagement3">
    <jar-file>order.jar</jar-file>
    <jar-file>order-supplemental.jar</jar-file>
</persistence-unit>
----

A persistence unit named _OrderManagement3_
is created. Any annotated managed persistence classes found in the root
of the persistence unit are added to the list of managed persistence
classes. If a _META-INF/orm.xml_ file exists, any classes and mapping
information contained in it are used as specified above. The _order.jar_
and _order-supplemental.jar_ files are searched for managed persistence
classes and any annotated managed persistence classes found in them
and/or any classes specified in the _orm.xml_ files of these jar files
are added. The transaction-type, data source and provider are as
described above.

*Example 4:*

[source,xml]
----
<persistence-unit name="OrderManagement4" transaction-type=RESOURCE_LOCAL>
    <non-jta-data-source>java:app/jdbc/MyDB</non-jta-data-source>
    <mapping-file>order-mappings.xml</mapping-file>
    <class>com.acme.Order</class>
    <class>com.acme.Customer</class>
    <class>com.acme.Item</class>
    <exclude-unlisted-classes/>
</persistence-unit>
----

A persistence unit named _OrderManagement4_
is created. The file _order-mappings.xml_ is read as a resource and any
classes referenced by it and mapping information contained in it are
usedfootnote:[Note that in this
example a META-INF/orm.xml file is assumed not to exist.].
The annotated _Order_, _Customer_ and
_Item_ classes are loaded and are added. No (other) classes contained in
the root of the persistence unit are added to the list of managed
persistence classes. The persistence unit assumed to be portable across
providers. A entity manager factory supplying resource-local entity
managers will be created. The data source _java:app/jdbc/MyDB_ must be
used.

*Example 5:*

[source,xml]
----
<persistence-unit name="OrderManagement5">
    <provider>com.acme.AcmePersistence</provider>
    <mapping-file>order1.xml</mapping-file>
    <mapping-file>order2.xml</mapping-file>
    <jar-file>order.jar</jar-file>
    <jar-file>order-supplemental.jar</jar-file>
</persistence-unit>
----

A persistence unit named _OrderManagement5_
is created. Any annotated managed persistence classes found in the root
of the persistence unit are added to the list of managed classes. The
_order1.xml_ and _order2.xml_ files are read as resources and any
classes referenced by them and mapping information contained in them are
also used as specified above. The _order.jar_ is a jar file on the
classpath containing another persistence unit, while
_order-supplemental.jar_ is just a library of classes. Both of these jar
files are searched for annotated managed persistence classes and any
annotated managed persistence classes found in them and any classes
specified in the _orm.xml_ files (if any) of these jar files are added.
The provider _com.acme.AcmePersistence_ must be used.

[NOTE]
====
Note that the _persistence.xml_ file
contained in _order.jar_ is not used to augment the persistence unit
_OrderManagement5_ with the classes of the persistence unit whose root
is _order.jar_.
====

==== Persistence Unit Scope [[a12459]]

An EJB-JAR, WAR, application client jar, or
EAR can define a persistence unit.

When referencing a persistence unit using the
_unitName_ annotation element or _persistence-unit-name_ deployment
descriptor element, the visibility scope of the persistence unit is
determined by its point of definition:

* A persistence unit that is defined at the
level of an EJB-JAR, WAR, or application client jar is scoped to that
EJB-JAR, WAR, or application jar respectively and is visible to the
components defined in that jar or war.
* A persistence unit that is defined at the
level of the EAR is generally visible to all components in the
application. However, if a persistence unit of the same name is defined
by an EJB-JAR, WAR, or application jar file within the EAR, the
persistence unit of that name defined at EAR level will not be visible
to the components defined by that EJB-JAR, WAR, or application jar file
unless the persistence unit reference uses the persistence unit name #
syntax to specify a path name to disambiguate the reference. When the #
syntax is used, the path name is relative to the referencing application
component jar file. For example, the syntax
_../lib/persistenceUnitRoot.jar#myPersistenceUnit_ refers to a
persistence unit whose name, as specified in the name element of the
_persistence.xml_ file, is _myPersistenceUnit_ and for which the
relative path name of the root of the persistence unit is
_../lib/persistenceUnitRoot.jar_. The # syntax may be used with both
the _unitName_ annotation element or _persistence-unit-name_ deployment
descriptor element to reference a persistence unit defined at EAR level.

=== persistence.xml Schema

This section provides the XML schema for the
_persistence.xml_ file.

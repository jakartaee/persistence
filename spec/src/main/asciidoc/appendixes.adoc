Added `equalTo()` and `notEqualTo()` to `Expression`

Added `concat()` overload accepting list of expressions to `CriteriaBuilder`

Added `Graph` interface as parent of `EntityGraph` and `Subgraph` and moved common operations there

Added `addAttributeNode()`, `removeAttributeNode()`, `addTreatedSubgraph()`, `addElementSubgraph()`, `addTreatedElementSubgraph()`,
`addMapKeySubgraph()`, and `addTreatedMapKeySubgraph()` methods to `Graph`

Added `find()`, `refresh()`, `lock()` overloads to `EntityManager` taking newly introduced ``FindOption``s, ``RefreshOption``s,
and ``LockOption``s respectively

Added `setCacheStoreMode()`, and `setCacheRetreiveMode()` methods to `EntityManager` and `Query`

Added `getReference` overload to `EntityManager`

Added `runWithConnection()` and `callWithConnection()` to `EntityManager`

Added `runInTransaction()` and `callInTransaction()` to `EntityManagerFactory`

Added `getName()` to `EntityManagerFactory`

Added programmatic API to obtain `EntityManagerFactory` using `PersistenceConfiguration`

Added constants for properties defined by the specification to the `PersistenceConfiguration`

Added `SchemaManager` API

Added options member to elements which result in DDL generation

Added `EnumeratedValue` allowing custom mapping of fields of Java enums

Added `comment` and `check` members to `@Table` and `@Column` annotations, along with `@CheckConstraint`

Added `secondPrecision` to `@Column` annotation and clarified semantics of `@Column` members

Added factory-level access to named queries and named entity graphs

Added integration points for dependency injection

Made the `name` member of `TableGenerator` and `SequenceGenerator` optional and allow usage of these annotations
at the java package level

Clarified the primary key types supported for each `GenerationType`

Clarified availability of `SEQUENCE`, `TABLE` and `UUID` generated IDs on `PrePersist`

Clarified semantics of numeric literals, numeric type promotions and added support for `bi` and `bd` suffixes

Clarified semantics of `Convert`/`Converter` annotations

Clarified rules around distinction of entity names and identification variables and case-sensitivity in Jakarta Persistence QL queries

Clarified the semantics of `Bindable.ENTITY_TYPE` in javadoc

Clarified the semantics of collection-valued query parameters

Entity and embeddable classes may now be static inner classes

Primary key classes are no longer required to be public and serializable

Pulled `getParameters()` up from `CriteriaQuery` to `CommonAbstractCriteria`

Updated persistence and object/relational mapping schemas

Fixed wildcard types in `addSubgraph` and `addAttributeNode` in `Graph`

Fixed lower type bounds to the `Path.get` entity argument `X`

Fixed example code in the javadoc of `AttributeOverrides`

Partially fixed raw types warnings through the API

Improved AsciiDoc formatting and fixed typos through the specification document

==== Deprecations

Deprecated usage of `Calendar`, `Date`, `Time`, `Timestamp`, `Temporal`, `MapKeyTemporal` and `TemporalType`
in new applications in favour of `java.time` API

Deprecated use of `Byte[]` and `Character[]` arrays types for basic attributes, in favor of primitive array types

Deprecated `multiselect` methods in `CriteriaQuery`. The preference is to use `array` or `tuple` method defined in `CriteriaBuilder`

==== Deprecations for removal

Deprecated `addSubclassSubgraph()` in `EntityGraph` for removal; `addTreatedSubgraph()` method should be used as direct replacement

Deprecated _addSubgraph(Attribute, Class)_ and `addKeySubgraph()` in `Graph`/`EntityGraph`/`SubGraph` for removal; `addTreatedSubgraph(Attribute, Class)`
and `addMapKeySubgraph()` methods should be used as direct replacements

Deprecated `jakarta.persistence.spi.PersistenceUnitTransactionType` for removal; `jakarta.persistence.PersistenceUnitTransactionType`
methods should be used as direct replacement

Deprecated default public no-arg constructor in `jakarta.persistence.Persistence` and `PERSISTENCE_PROVIDER` and `providers` fields
in this class for removal with no replacement. This class is not designed for extensibility

=== Jakarta Persistence 3.1

`EntityManagerFactory` and `EntityManager` interfaces extend `java.lang.AutoCloseable` interface

Fixed `ClassTransformer.transform` to throw Persistence API specific exception

Added support for `java.util.UUID` and `GenerationType.UUID`

Added `CEILING`, `EXP`, `FLOOR`, `LN`, `POWER`, `ROUND`, and `SIGN`
numeric functions to Jakarta Persistence QL and `ceiling()`, `exp()`,
`floor()`, `ln()`, `power()`,  `round()`, and `sign()` to Criteria API

Added `LOCAL DATE`, `LOCAL DATETIME`, and `LOCAL TIME` functions to Jakarta Persistence QL and
corresponding `localDate()`, `localDateTime()`, and `localTime()` to Criteria API

Added `EXTRACT` function to Jakarta Persistence QL

Added support for ``Expression``s as conditions in `Criteria` `CASE` expressions

Clarified mixing types of query input parameters

Added missing definition of `single_valued_embeddable_object_field` in Jakarta Persistence QL BNF

Clarified definition of the `Basic` type

Clarified the order of parameters in the `LOCATE` function

Clarified `SqlResultSetMapping` with multiple ``EntityResult``s and conflicting aliases

=== Jakarta Persistence 3.0

Created document from Java Persistence 2.2 Final Release specification.

The document was converted to `Asciidoc` format.

Packages of all API classes were changed to `jakarta.persistence`. These changes are reflected in the specification document.

Schema namespaces were changed from http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence and http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence/orm
to https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence and https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/orm

References to schema versions lower than 2.2 were removed.

=== Java Persistence 2.2 (Maintenance Release Draft)

Created document from Java Persistence 2.1
Final Release specification.

The following annotations have been marked `@Repeatable`:

* `AssociationOverride`
* `AttributeOverride`
* `Convert`
* `JoinColumn`
* `MapKeyJoinColumn`
* `NamedEntityGraph`
* `NamedNativeQuery`
* `NamedQuery`
* `NamedStoredProcedureQuery`
* `PersistenceContext`
* `PersistenceUnit`
* `PrimaryKeyJoinColumn`
* `SecondaryTable`
* `SqlResultSetMapping`
* `SequenceGenerator`
* `TableGenerator`

Added `SequenceGenerators` and `TableGenerators` annotations.

Added support for CDI injection into
`AttributeConverter` classes.

Added support for the mapping of the following java.time types:

* `java.time.LocalDate`
* `java.time.LocalTime`
* `java.time.LocalDateTime`
* `java.time.OffsetTime`
* `java.time.OffsetDateTime`

Added default `Stream getResultStream()` method
to Query interface.

Added default `Stream<X> getResultStream()`
method to TypedQuery interface.

Replaced reference to JAR file specification
in persistence provider bootstrapping section with more general
reference to Java SE service provider requirements.

Updated persistence.xml and orm.xml schemas to 2.2 versions.

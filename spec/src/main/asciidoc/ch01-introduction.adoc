== Introduction

This document is the specification of the Jakarta API for the management
of persistence and object/relational mapping in the Jakarta EE and Java SE
platforms. The technical objective of this work is to provide a standard
object/relational mapping facility for the Java application developer using
a Java domain model to manage data held in a relational database.

- Jakarta Persistence 4.0 is a major revision of the APIs, adding the
  `EntityAgent`, programmatic result set mappings, support for static
  queries, enhancements to entity graphs and `StoredProcedureQuery`, and
  new lifecycle events. Its feature set is targeted to support usage with
  Jakarta Data.

- The Jakarta Persistence 3.2 specification began the process of modernizing
  and updating the APIs for ease of use and greater type safety.

- The Jakarta Persistence 3.1 specification was the first release with new
  features and enhancements after the specification was moved to the Eclipse
  Foundation.

- The Jakarta Persistence 3.0 specification was the first release after moving
  the project to Eclipse Foundation. All APIs were moved from the package
  `javax.pass:[*]` to the package `jakarta.pass:[*]`. Every property name
  containing `javax` was renamed so that `javax` is replaced with `jakarta`.

- The Java Persistence 2.2 specification enhanced the API with support for
  repeating annotations; injection into attribute converters; support for
  mapping the `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, `OffsetTime`, and
  `OffsetDateTime` types from `java.time`; and methods to retrieve the results
  of `Query` and `TypedQuery` as streams.

- The Java Persistence 2.1 specification added support for schema generation,
  type conversion methods, use of entity graphs in queries and find operations,
  unsynchronized persistence contexts, stored procedure invocation, and injection
  into entity listener classes. It also included enhancements to the query language,
  the Criteria API, and to the mapping of native queries.

=== Authorship

The Jakarta Persistence Specification incorporates work done over two decades
by the EJB 3.0 expert group, the Java Persistence 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 expert
groups, under the aegis of the Java Community Process, and by the Jakarta
Persistence project at the Eclipse Foundation.

=== Document Conventions

Regular serif font is used for information that is prescriptive under this
specification.

Admonitions are used for paragraphs that contain descriptive information
clarifications, explanations, and recommendations.

`Monospaced font` is used for code examples and to specify the BNF of the
Jakarta Persistence query language.

Java types belonging to the namespace `jakarta.persistence` are usually
referred to by their unqualified names when there is no ambiguity.

This document defines the semantics of a set of Java language annotations.
An XML descriptor (as specified in <<a16944>>) may be used as an alternative
to annotations or to augment or override annotations. The elements of this
descriptor mirror the annotations and have identical semantics to the
corresponding annotations. When semantic requirements are written in terms
of annotations, it should be understood that the same semantics apply to the
corresponding elements of the XML descriptor.

== Introduction

This document is the specification of the
Jakarta API for the management of persistence and object/relational mapping
with Jakarta EE and Java SE. The technical objective of this work is to
provide an object/relational mapping facility for the Java application
developer using a Java domain model to manage a relational database.

The Jakarta Persistence 3.1 specification is the first release having
new features and enhancements after the specification has been moved
to the Eclipse Foundation.

The Jakarta Persistence 3.0 specification is the first release after
moving the project to Eclipse Foundation. All APIs are moved from _javax.*_
package to _jakarta.*_ package. All properties containing _javax_ as
part of the name are renamed the way that _javax_ is replaced with _jakarta_.

The Java Persistence 2.2 specification
enhances the Jakarta Persistence API with support for repeating
annotations; injection into attribute converters; support for mapping of
the _java.time.LocalDate_, _java.time.LocalTime_, _java.time.LocalDateTime_,
_java.time.OffsetTime_, and _java.time.OffsetDateTime_ types; and methods to
retrieve the results of _Query_ and _TypedQuery_ as streams.

The Java Persistence 2.1 specification added
support for schema generation, type conversion methods, use of entity
graphs in queries and find operations, unsynchronized persistence
contexts, stored procedure invocation, and injection into entity
listener classes. It also includes enhancements to the Java Persistence
query language, the Criteria API, and to the mapping of native queries.

=== Expert Group

The Jakarta Persistence Specification is based on
Java Persistence (JPA) 2.2, whose work was conducted as part of JSR 338 under the
Java Community Process Program. The specification is the result of the
collaborative work of the members of the JSR 338 Expert Group: akquinet
tech@Spree: Michael Bouschen; Ericsson: Nicolas Seyvet; IBM: Kevin
Sutter, Pinaki Poddar; OW2: Florent Benoit; Oracle: Linda DeMichiel,
Gordon Yorke, Michael Keith; Pramati Technologies: Deepak Anupalli; Red
Hat, Inc.: Emmanuel Bernard, Steve Ebersole, Scott Marlow; SAP AG:
Rainer Schweigkoffer; Sybase: Evan Ireland; Tmax Soft Inc.: Miju Byon;
Versant: Christian von Kutzleben; VMware: Oliver Gierke; individual
members: Matthew Adams; Adam Bien; Bernd Mueller; Werner Keil.

The work of the JSR 338 Expert Group was
conducted using the jpa-spec.java.net project.

=== Document Conventions

The regular Times font is used for
information that is prescriptive by this specification.

_The italic Times font is used for paragraphs
that contain descriptive information, such as notes describing typical
use, or notes clarifying the text with prescriptive specification._

A monospaced font is used for code examples and to specify the BNF of the
Jakarta Persistence query language.

This document is written in terms of the
use of Java language metadata annotations. An XML descriptor (as
specified in <<a16944>>) may be used as an alternative to
annotations or to augment or override annotations. The elements of this
descriptor mirror the annotations and have the same semantics. When
semantic requirements are written in terms of annotations, it should be
understood that the same semantics apply when the XML descriptor is used
as an alternative.

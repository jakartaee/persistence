== Container and Provider Contracts for Deployment and Bootstrapping

This chapter defines requirements on the Jakarta EE container and on
the persistence provider for deployment and bootstrapping.

=== Jakarta EE Deployment [[a12802]]

Each persistence unit deployed into a Jakarta EE
container consists of a single _persistence.xml_ file, any number of
mapping files, and any number of class files.

At deployment time the container is
responsible for scanning the locations specified in <<a12236>> and
discovering the _persistence.xml_ files and processing them.

When the container finds a _persistence.xml_
file, it must process the persistence unit definitions that it contains.
The container must validate the _persistence.xml_ file against the
__persistence_3_0.xsd__ or __persistence_2_2.xsd__ schema in accordance with
the version specified by the _persistence.xml_ file and report any validation errors.
Provider or data source information not specified in the _persistence.xml_ file
must be provided at deployment time or defaulted by the container. The
container may optionally add any container-specific properties to be
passed to the provider when creating the entity manager factory for the
persistence unit.

Once the container has read the persistence
metadata, it determines the _jakarta.persistence.spi.PersistenceProvider_
implementation class for each deployed named persistence unit. The
container then creates an instance of the _PersistenceProvider_
implementation class for each deployed named persistence unit and
invokes the _createContainerEntityManagerFactory_ method on that
instance.

* The container must implement the
_PersistenceUnitInfo_ interface described in <<a13160>> and pass the
metadata—in the form of a _PersistenceUnitInfo_ instance—to the
persistence provider as part of this call.
* If a Bean Validation provider exists in the
container environment and the _validation-mode_ _NONE_ is not specified,
a _ValidatorFactory_ instance must be made available by the container.
The container is responsible for passing this _ValidatorFactory_
instance via the map that is passed as an argument to the
_createContainerEntityManagerFactory_ call. The map key used must be the
standard property name _jakarta.persistence.validation.factory_.
* If CDI is enabled, a _BeanManager_ instance
must be made available by the container. The container is responsible
for passing this _BeanManager_ instance via the map that is passed as an
argument to the _createContainerEntityManagerFactory_ call. The map key
used must be the standard property name _jakarta.persistence.bean.manager_.

The _EntityManagerFactory_ instance obtained
as a result will be used by the container to create container-managed
entity managers. Only one EntityManagerFactory is permitted to be
created for each deployed persistence unit configuration. Any number of
EntityManager instances may be created from a given factory.

In a Jakarta EE environment, the classes of the
persistence unit should not be loaded by the application class loader or
any of its parent class loaders until after the entity manager factory
for the persistence unit has been created.

When a persistence unit is redeployed, the
container should call the _close_ method on the previous
_EntityManagerFactory_ instance and call the
_createContainerEntityManagerFactory_ method again, with the required
_PersistenceUnitInfo_ metadata, to achieve the redeployment.

=== Bootstrapping in Java SE Environments

In Java SE environments, the
_Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory_ method is used by the
application to create an entity manager factoryfootnote:[Use of these Java SE
bootstrapping APIs may be supported in Jakarta EE containers; however,
support for such use is not required.].

A persistence provider implementation running
in a Java SE environment should also act as a service provider by
supplying a service provider configuration file as defined by the Java
SE platform.

The provider configuration file serves to
export the provider implementation class to the _Persistence_ bootstrap
class, positioning the provider as a candidate for backing named
persistence units. The provider supplies the provider configuration file
by creating a text file named
_jakarta.persistence.spi.PersistenceProvider_ and placing it in the
_META-INF/services_ directory of one of its JAR files. The contents of
the file should be the name of the provider implementation class of the
_jakarta.persistence.spi.PersistenceProvider_ interface.

*Example:*

A persistence vendor called ACME persistence
products ships a JAR called _acme.jar_ that contains its persistence
provider implementation. The JAR includes the provider configuration
file.

----
acme.jar
    META-INF/services/jakarta.persistence.spi.PersistenceProvider
    com.acme.PersistenceProvider
    ...
----

The contents of the
_META-INF/services/jakarta.persistence.spi.PersistenceProvider_ file is
nothing more than the name of the implementation class:
_com.acme.PersistenceProvider_.

Persistence provider jars may be installed or
made available in the same ways as other service providers, e.g. as
extensions or added to the application classpath.

The _Persistence_ bootstrap class must locate
all of the persistence providers using the _PersistenceProviderResolver_
mechanism described in <<a12837>> and call
_createEntityManagerFactory_ on them in turn until an appropriate
backing provider returns an _EntityManagerFactory_ instance. A provider
may deem itself as appropriate for the persistence unit if any of the
following are true:

* Its implementation class has been specified
in the _provider_ element for that persistence unit in the
_persistence.xml_ file and has not been overridden by a different
_jakarta.persistence.provider_ property value included in the Map passed
to the _createEntityManagerFactory_ method.
* The _jakarta.persistence.provider_ property was
included in the Map passed to _createEntityManagerFactory_ and the value
of the property is the provider's implementation class.
* No provider was specified for the persistence
unit in either the _persistence.xml_ or the property map.

If a provider does not qualify as the
provider for the named persistence unit, it must return _null_ when
_createEntityManagerFactory_ is invoked on it.

==== Schema Generation

In Java SE environments, the
_Persistence.generateSchema_ method may be used by the application to
cause schema generation to occur as a separate phase from entity manager
factory creation.

In this case, the _Persistence_ bootstrap
class must locate all of the persistence providers using the
_PersistenceProviderResolver_ mechanism described in <<a12837>>
and call _generateSchema_ on them in turn until an
appropriate backing provider returns _true_. A provider may deem itself
as appropriate for the persistence unit if any of the following are
true:

* Its implementation class has been specified
in the _provider_ element for that persistence unit in the
_persistence.xml_ file and has not been overridden by a different
_jakarta.persistence.provider_ property value included in the Map passed
to the _generateSchema_ method.
* The _jakarta.persistence.provider_ property was
included in the Map passed to _generateSchema_ and the value of the
property is the provider's implementation class.
* No provider was specified for the persistence
unit in either the _persistence.xml_ or the property map.

If a provider does not qualify as the
provider for the named persistence unit, it must return _false_ when
_generateSchema_ is invoked on it.

=== Determining the Available Persistence Providers [[a12837]]

The _PersistenceProviderResolver_ and
_PersistenceProviderResolverHolder_ mechanism supports the dynamic
discovery of persistence providers.footnote:[In dynamic
environments (e.g., OSGi-based environments, containers based on dynamic
kernels, etc.), the list of persistence providers may change.]

The _PersistenceProviderResolver_ instance is
responsible for returning the list of providers available in the
environment.

The _PersistenceProviderResolverHolder_ class
holds the _PersistenceProviderResolver_ instance that is in use. The
implementation of _PersistenceProviderResolverHolder_ must be
threadsafe, but no guarantee is made against multiple threads setting
the resolver.

The container is allowed to implement
and set a specific _PersistenceProviderResolver_ provided that it
respects the _PersistenceProviderResolver_ contract. The
_PersistenceProviderResolver_ instance to be used is set by the
container using the
_PersistenceProviderResolverHolder.setPersistenceProviderResolver_
method.footnote:[If a custom
PersistenceProviderResolver is needed in a JavaSE environment, it must
be set before Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory is called. Note,
however, that the setPersistenceProviderResolver method is not intended
for general use, but rather is aimed at containers maintaining a dynamic
environment.]

If no _PersistenceProviderResolver_ is set,
the _PersistenceProviderResolverHolder_ must return a
_PersistenceProviderResolver_ that returns the providers whose
persistence provider jars have been installed or made available as
service providers or extensions. This default
_PersistenceProviderResolver_ instance does not guarantee the order in
which persistence providers are returned.

A _PersistenceProviderResolver_ must be threadsafe.

The
_PersistenceProviderResolver.getPersistenceProviders()_ method must be
used to determine the list of available persistence providers.

The results of calling the
_PersistenceProviderResolverHolder.getPersistenceProviderResolver_ and
the _PersistenceProviderResolver.getPersistenceProviders_ methods must
not be cached. In particular, the following methods must use the
_PersistenceProviderResolver_ instance returned by the
_PersistenceProviderResolverHolder.getPersistenceProviderResolver_
method to determine the list of available providers:


* _Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(String)_
* _Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(String, Map)_
* _PersistenceUtil.isLoaded(Object)_
* _PersistenceUtil.isLoaded(Object, String)_

These methods must not cache the list of
providers and must not cache the _PersistenceProviderResolver_ instance.

[NOTE]
====
Note that the
_PersistenceProviderResolver.getPersistenceProviders()_ method can
potentially be called many times. It is therefore recommended that the
implementation of this method make use of caching.
====

Note that only a single
_PersistenceProviderResolver_ instance can be defined in a given
classloader hierarchy at a given time.

public interface PersistenceProviderResolver {

    /**

    }

    public static void setPersistenceProviderResolver(PersistenceProviderResolver resolver) {
        if (resolver == null) {
            singleton = new DefaultPersistenceProviderResolver();
        } else {
            singleton = resolver;
        }
    }

}

=== Schema Generation [[a12917]]

In cases where a preconfigured database (or a
“legacy” database) is not used or is not available, the Jakarta Persistence
schema generation facility may be used to generate the tables and other
database artifacts required by the persistence application. Whether
schema generation entails the creation of schemas proper in the database
is determined by the environment and the configuration of the schema
generation process, as described below.

Schema generation may happen either prior to
application deployment or when the entity manager factory is created as
part of the application deployment and initialization process.

* In Jakarta EE environments, the container may
call the _PersistenceProvider_ _generateSchema_ method separately from
and/or prior to the creation of the entity manager factory for the
persistence unit, or the container may pass additional information to
the _createContainerEntityManagerFactory_ call to cause schema
generation to happen as part of the entity manager factory creation and
application initialization process. The information passed to these
methods controls whether the generation occurs directly in the target
database, whether DDL scripts for schema generation are created, or
both.
* In Java SE environments, the application may
call the _Persistence_ _generateSchema_ method separately from and/or
prior to the creation of the entity manager factory or may pass
information to the _createEntityManagerFactory_ method to cause schema
generation to occur as part of the entity manager factory creation.

The application may provide DDL scripts to be
used for schema generation as described in <<a12384>>. The application developer
may package these scripts as part of the persistence unit or may specify
strings corresponding to file URLs for the location of such scripts. In
Jakarta EE environments, such scripts may be executed by the container, or
the container may direct the persistence provider to execute the
scripts. In Java SE environments, the execution of the scripts is the
responsibility of the persistence provider. In the absence of the
specification of scripts, schema generation, if requested, will be
determined by the object/relational metadata of the persistence unit.

The following standard properties are defined
for configuring the schema generation process. In Jakarta EE environments
these properties are passed by the container in the _Map_ argument to
either the _PersistenceProvider_ _generateSchema_ method or the
_createContainerEntityManagerFactory_ method. In Java SE environments,
they are passed in the _Map_ argument to either the _Persistence_
_generateSchema_ method or _createEntityManagerFactory_ method.

In Jakarta EE environments, any strings
corresponding to file URLs for script sources or targets must specify
absolute paths (not relative). In Jakarta EE environments, all source and
target file locations must be accessible to the application server
deploying the persistence unit

* _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action_ +
The _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action_ property specifies
the action to be taken by the persistence provider with regard to the
database artifacts. The values for this property are _"none"_,
_"create"_, _"drop-and-create"_, _"drop"_. If the
_jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action_ property is not
specified, no schema generation actions must be taken on the database.
* _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.action_ +
The _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.action_ property specifies
which scripts are to be generated by the persistence provider. The
values for this property are _"none"_, _"create"_, _"drop-and-create"_
, _"drop"_. A script will only be generated if the script target is
specified. If this property is not specified, no scripts will be
generated.
* _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.create-source_ +
The _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.create-source_ property specifies
whether the creation of database artifacts is to occur on the basis of
the object/relational mapping metadata, DDL script, or a combination of
the two. The values for this property are _"metadata"_, _"script"_,
_"metadata-then-script"_, _"script-then-metadata"_. If this property
is not specified, and a script is specified by the
_jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.create-script-source_ property, the
script (only) will be used for schema generation; otherwise if this
property is not specified, schema generation will occur on the basis of
the object/relational mapping metadata (only). The
_"metadata-then-script"_ and _"script-then-metadata"_ values specify
that a combination of metadata and script is to be used and the order in
which this use is to occur. If either of these values is specified and
the resulting database actions are not disjoint, the results are
undefined and schema generation may fail.
* _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.drop-source_ +
The _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.drop-source_ property specifies
whether the dropping of database artifacts is to occur on the basis of
the object/relational mapping metadata, DDL script, or a combination of
the two. The values for this property are _"metadata"_, _"script"_,
_"metadata-then-script"_, _"script-then-metadata"_. If this property
is not specified, and a script is specified by the
_jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.drop-script-source_ property, the
script (only) will be used for the dropping of database artifacts;
otherwise if this property is not specified, the dropping of database
artifacts will occur on the basis of the object/relational mapping
metadata (only). The _"metadata-then-script"_ and
_"script-then-metadata"_ values specify that a combination of metadata
and script is to be used and the order in which this use is to occur. If
either of these values is specified and the resulting database actions
are not disjoint, the results are undefined and the dropping of database
artifacts may fail.
* _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.create-database-schemas_ +
In Jakarta EE environments, it is anticipated
that the Jakarta EE platform provider may wish to control the creation of
database schemas rather than delegate this task to the persistence
provider. The
_jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.create-database-schemas_ property
specifies whether the persistence provider is to create the database
schema(s) in addition to creating database objects such as tables,
sequences, constraints, etc. The value of this boolean property should
be set to true if the persistence provider is to create schemas in the
database or to generate DDL that contains “CREATE SCHEMA” commands. If
this property is not supplied, the provider should not attempt to create
database schemas. This property may also be specified in Java SE
environments.
* _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.create-target_, +
_jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.drop-target_ +
If scripts are to be generated, the target
locations for the writing of these scripts must be specified. +
The _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.create-target_ property
specifies a _java.IO.Writer_ configured for use by the persistence
provider for output of the DDL script or a string specifying the file
URL for the DDL script. This property should only be specified if
scripts are to be generated. +
The _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.drop-target_ property
specifies a _java.IO.Writer_ configured for use by the persistence
provider for output of the DDL script or a string specifying the file
URL for the DDL script. This property should only be specified if
scripts are to be generated.
* _jakarta.persistence.database-product-name_, +
_jakarta.persistence.database-major-version_, +
_jakarta.persistence.database-minor-version_ +
If scripts are to be generated by the
persistence provider and a connection to the target database is not
supplied, the _jakarta.persistence.database-product-name_ property must be
specified. The value of this property should be the value returned for
the target database by the JDBC _DatabaseMetaData_ method
_getDatabaseProductName_. If sufficient database version information is
not included in the result of this method, the
_jakarta.persistence.database-major-version_ and
_jakarta.persistence.database-minor-version_ properties should be
specified as needed. These should contain the values returned by the
JDBC _getDatabaseMajorVersion_ and _getDatabaseMinorVersion_ methods
respectively.
* _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.create-script-source_, +
_jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.drop-script-source_ +
The _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.create-script-source_ and
_jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.drop-script-source_ properties are
used for script execution. In Jakarta EE container environments, it is
generally expected that the container will be responsible for executing
DDL scripts, although the container is permitted to delegate this task
to the persistence provider. If DDL scripts are to be used in Java SE
environments or if the Jakarta EE container delegates the execution of
scripts to the persistence provider, these properties must be specified. +
The
_jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.create-script-source_ property
specifies a _java.IO.Reader_ configured for reading of the DDL script or
a string designating a file URL for the DDL script. +
The
_jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.drop-script-source_ property
specifies a _java.IO.Reader_ configured for reading of the DDL script or
a string designating a file URL for the DDL script.
* _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.connection_ +
The _jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.connection_ property specifies the
JDBC connection to be used for schema generation. This is intended for
use in Jakarta EE environments, where the platform provider may want to
control the database privileges that are available to the persistence
provider. This connection is provided by the container, and should be
closed by the container when the schema generation request or entity
manager factory creation completes. The connection provided must have
credentials sufficient for the persistence provider to carry out the
requested actions. If this property is not specified, the persistence
provider should use the DataSource that has otherwise been provided.

==== Data Loading

Data loading, by means of the use of SQL
scripts, may occur as part of the schema generation process after the
creation of the database artifacts or independently of schema
generation. The specification of the
_jakarta.persistence.sql-load-script-source_ controls whether data loading
will occur.

* _jakarta.persistence.sql-load-script-source_ +
In Jakarta EE container environments, it is
generally expected that the container will be responsible for executing
data load scripts, although the container is permitted to delegate this
task to the persistence provider. If a load script is to be used in Java
SE environments or if the Jakarta EE container delegates the execution of
the load script to the persistence provider, this property must be
specified. + The
_jakarta.persistence.sql-load-script-source_ property specifies a
_java.IO.Reader_ configured for reading of the SQL load script for
database initialization or a string designating a file URL for the
script.

=== Responsibilities of the Persistence Provider

The persistence provider must implement the
_PersistenceProvider_ SPI.

In Jakarta EE environments, the persistence
provider must process the metadata that is passed to it at the time
_createContainerEntityManagerFactory_ method is called and create an
instance of _EntityManagerFactory_ using the _PersistenceUnitInfo_
metadata for the factory. The factory is then returned to the container.

In Java SE environments, the persistence
provider must validate the _persistence.xml_ file against the
_persistence_ schema that corresponds to the version specified by the
_persistence.xml_ file and report any validation errors.

The persistence provider processes the
metadata annotations on the managed classes of the persistence unit.

When the entity manager factory for a
persistence unit is created, it is the responsibility of the persistence
provider to initialize the state of the metamodel classes of the
persistence unit.

When the persistence provider obtains an
object/relational mapping file, it processes the definitions that it
contains. The persistence provider must validate any object/relational
mapping files against the object/relational mapping schema version
specified by the object/relational mapping file and report any
validation errors. The object relational mapping file must specify the
object/relational mapping schema that it is written against by
indicating the _version_ element.

In Java SE environments, the application can
pass the _ValidatorFactory_ instance via the map that is passed as an
argument to the _Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory_ call. The map
key used must be the standard property name
_jakarta.persistence.validation.factory_. If no _ValidatorFactory_
instance is provided by the application, and if a Bean Validation
provider is present in the classpath, the persistence provider must
instantiate the _ValidatorFactory_ using the default bootstrapping
approach as defined by the Bean Validation specification
<<a19498>>, namely
_Validation.buildDefaultValidatorFactory()_.

==== jakarta.persistence.spi.PersistenceProvider

The interface
_jakarta.persistence.spi.PersistenceProvider_ must be implemented by the
persistence provider.

It is invoked by the container in Jakarta EE
environments and by the _jakarta.persistence.Persistence_ class in Java SE
environments. The _jakarta.persistence.spi.PersistenceProvider_
implementation is not intended to be used by the application.

The _PersistenceProvider_ implementation
class must have a public no-arg constructor.

_jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.drop-target_ property in
the _persistence.xml_. See <<a12384>>.

The following additional standard properties
are defined by this specification for the configuration of the entity
manager factory:

* _jakarta.persistence.jdbc.driver_ — value is
the fully qualified name of the driver class.
* _jakarta.persistence.jdbc.url_ — string
corresponding to the driver-specific URL.
* _jakarta.persistence.jdbc.user_ — value is the
username used by database connection.
* _jakarta.persistence.jdbc.password_ — value is
the password for database connection validation.
* _jakarta.persistence.dataSource_ — value is
instance of _javax.sql.DataSource_ to be used for the specified
persistence unit.
* _jakarta.persistence.validation.factory_ —
value is instance of _jakarta.validation.ValidatorFactory_.

Any number of vendor-specific properties may
also be included in the map. If a persistence provider does not
recognize a property (other than a property defined by this
specification), the provider must ignore it.

Vendors should use vendor namespaces for
properties (e.g., _com.acme.persistence.logging_). Entries that make
use of the namespace _jakarta.persistence_ and its subnamespaces must not
be used for vendor-specific information. The namespace
_jakarta.persistence_ is reserved for use by this specification.

=== PersistenceUtil Interface

This interface is used to determine load
state. The semantics of the methods of this interface are defined in
<<a13592>> below.

==== Contracts for Determining the Load State of an Entity or Entity Attribute [[a13592]]

The implementation of the
_PersistenceUtil.isLoaded(Object)_ method must determine the list of
persistence providers available in the runtime
environmentfootnote:[The determining of
the persistence providers that are available is discussed in <<a12837>>.] and call the
_ProviderUtil.isLoaded(Object)_ method on each of them until either:

* one provider returns _LoadState.LOADED_. In
this case _PersistenceUtil.isLoaded_ returns _true_.
* one provider returns _LoadState.NOT_LOADED_.
In this case _PersistenceUtil.isLoaded_ returns _false_.
* all providers return _LoadState.UNKNOWN_. In
this case _PersistenceUtil.isLoaded_ returns _true_.

If the _PersistenceUtil_ implementation
determines that only a single provider is available in the environment,
it is permitted to use provider-specific methods to determine the result
of _isLoaded(Object)_ as long as the semantics defined in <<a2019>> are observed.

The implementation of the
_PersistenceUtil.isLoaded(Object,String)_ method must determine the list
of persistence providers available in the environment and call the
_ProviderUtil.isLoadedWithoutReference_ method on each of them until
either:

* one provider returns _LoadState.LOADED_. In
this case _PersistenceUtil.isLoaded_ returns _true_.
* one provider returns _LoadState.NOT_LOADED_.
In this case _PersistenceUtil.isLoaded_ returns _false_.
* all providers return _LoadState.UNKNOWN_. In
this case, the _PersistenceUtil.isLoaded_ method then calls
_ProviderUtil.isLoadedWithReference_ on each of the providers until:
** one provider returns _LoadState.LOADED_. In
this case _PersistenceUtil.isLoaded_ return _true_.
** one provider returns _LoadState.NOT_LOADED_.
In this case, _PersistenceUtil.isLoaded_ returns _false_.
** all providers return _LoadState.UNKNOWN_. In
this case, _PersistenceUtil.isLoaded_ returns _true_.

If the _PersistenceUtil_ implementation
determines that only a single provider is available in the environment,
it is permitted to use provider specific methods to determine the result
of _isLoaded(Object, String)_ as long as the semantics defined in
<<a2019>> are observed.

NOTE: The rationale for splitting the
determination of load state between the methods isLoadedWithoutReference
and isLoadedWithReference is the following.

* _It is assumed that the provider that loaded
the entity is present in the environment._
* _Providers that use bytecode enhancement
don't need to access an attribute reference to determine its load state,
and can determine if the entity has been provided by them._
* _By first querying all providers using
bytecode enhancement, it is insured that no attribute will be loaded by
side effect._
* _Proxy-based providers do need to access an
attribute reference to determine load state, but will not trigger
attribute loading as a side effect._
* _If no provider recognizes an entity as
provided by it, it is assumed to be an object that is not instrumented
and is considered loaded._

== Metamodel API [[a6072]]

This specification provides a set of interfaces for dynamically accessing
a metamodel representing the managed classes of a persistence unit.
Instances of metamodel types may be obtained either:

- via programmatic lookup using an instance of the interface `Metamodel`
  (found in <<_metamodel_>>) obtained from the `EntityManagerFactory` or
  `EntityManager` by calling `getMetamodel()`, or
- in a typesafe way, using _static metamodel classes_.

A static metamodel class is a class with static members providing direct
typesafe access to metamodel objects representing the persistent members
of a given managed class.

=== Static Metamodel Classes [[a6933]]

A set of static metamodel classes corresponding to the managed classes of
a persistence unit can be generated using an annotation processor or may
be created by the application developer.

In the typical case, an annotation processor is used to generate static
metamodel classes corresponding to the entities, mapped superclasses,
and embeddable classes in the persistence unit. A static metamodel class
models the persistent state and relationships of the corresponding managed
class. For portability, an annotation processor should generate a _canonical
metamodel_ as specified in the next section.

==== Canonical Metamodel

This specification defines as follows a
canonical metamodel and the structure of canonical metamodel classes.

For every managed class in the persistence
unit, a corresponding metamodel class is produced as follows:

* For each managed class `X` in package `p`, a metamodel class
`X_` in package `p` is created.footnote:[We expect that the
option of different packages will be provided in a future release of
this specification.]

* The name of the metamodel class is derived from the name of the
managed class by appending "`_`" to the name of the managed class.

* The metamodel class `X_` must be annotated with the `StaticMetamodel`
annotation found in <<_staticmetamodel_>>.footnote:[If the class was
generated, it should also be annotated with either
`javax.annotation.processing.Generated` or `jakarta.annotation.Generated`.
The use of any other annotations on static metamodel classes is undefined.]

* If the managed class `X` extends another class `S`, where `S` is the
most derived managed class (i.e., entity or mapped superclass) extended
by `X`, then the metamodel class `X_` must extend the metamodel
class `S_` created for `S`.

* The metamodel class must contain a field declaration as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
public static volatile jakarta.persistence.metamodel.T<X> class_;
----
+
where `T` is `EntityType`, `EmbeddableType`, or `MappedSuperclassType`
depending on whether `X` is an entity, embeddable, or mapped superclass.
* For every persistent attribute `y` declared by class `X`, the
metamodel class must contain a field declaration as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
public static final String Y = "y";
----
+
where the field name `Y` is obtained by transforming each lowercase
character in the attribute name `y` to uppercase, inserting an
underscore if the character following the transformed character
is uppercase, and then replacing each character which is not
a legal Java identifier character with an underscore.

* For every persistent non-collection-valued
attribute `y` declared by class `X`, where the type of `y` is `Y`, the
metamodel class must contain a declaration as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
public static volatile SingularAttribute<X, Y> y;
----
+

* For every persistent collection-valued
attribute `z` declared by class `X`, where the element type of `z` is
`Z`, the metamodel class must contain a declaration as follows:
** if the collection type of `z` is `java.util.Collection`, then
+
[source,java]
----
public static volatile CollectionAttribute<X, Z> z;
----
+
** if the collection type of `z` is `java.util.Set`, then
+
[source,java]
----
public static volatile SetAttribute<X, Z> z;
----
+
** if the collection type of `z` is `java.util.List`, then
+
[source,java]
----
public static volatile ListAttribute<X, Z> z;
----
+
** if the collection type of `z` is `java.util.Map`, then
+
[source,java]
----
public static volatile MapAttribute<X, K, Z> z;
----
+
where `K` is the type of the key of the map in class `X`

* For every named query, named entity graph, or SQL result set
mapping with name `"n"` declared by annotations of the class `X`,
the metamodel class must contain a declaration as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
public static final String T_N = "n";
----
+
where the prefix `T` is the string `QUERY`, `GRAPH`, or `MAPPING`,
as appropriate, depending on the annotation type, and the suffix
`N` is obtained by transforming each lowercase character in the
name `n` to uppercase, inserting an underscore if the character
following the transformed character is uppercase, and then
replacing each character which is not a legal Java identifier
character with an underscore.

* For every named query with name `"n"` and query result class
`R` declared by annotations of the class `X`, the metamodel class
must contain a declaration as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
public static volatile TypedQueryReference<R> _n_;
----
+
where `n` is the name `"n"` with every character which is not a legal Java identifier character
replaced with an underscore.

* For every named entity graph with name `"n"` declared by
annotations of the class `X`, the metamodel class must contain
a declaration as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
public static volatile EntityGraph<X> _n;
----
+
where `n` is the name `"n"` with every character which is not a legal Java identifier character
replaced with an underscore.

Import statements must be included for the
needed `jakarta.persistence` and `jakarta.persistence.metamodel` types as appropriate
and all classes `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `R`, and `K`.

[NOTE]
====
Implementations of this specification are not required to resolve naming collisions
resulting from the rules above when generating canonical metamodel classes.

[NOTE]
====
Implementations of this specification are
not required to support the use of non-canonical metamodel classes.
Applications that use non-canonical metamodel classes will not be
portable.

===== Example Canonical Metamodel [[a6961]]

Assume the `Order` entity below.

[source,java]
----
package com.example;

import java.util.Set;
import java.math.BigDecimal;
import jakarta.persistence.Entity;
import jakarta.persistence.Id;
import jakarta.persistence.ManyToOne;
import jakarta.persistence.OneToMany;

@Entity
public class Order {
    @Id
    Integer orderId;

    @ManyToOne
    Customer customer;

    @OneToMany
    Set<Item> lineItems;

    Address shippingAddress;

    BigDecimal totalCost;

    // ...
}
----

The corresponding canonical metamodel class, `Order_`, is as follows:

[source,java]
----
package com.example;

import java.math.BigDecimal;
import jakarta.persistence.metamodel.EntityType;
import jakarta.persistence.metamodel.SingularAttribute;
import jakarta.persistence.metamodel.SetAttribute;
import jakarta.persistence.metamodel.StaticMetamodel;

@StaticMetamodel(Order.class)
public class Order_ {
    public static volatile EntityType<Order> class_;

    public static volatile SingularAttribute<Order, Integer> orderId;
    public static volatile SingularAttribute<Order, Customer> customer;
    public static volatile SetAttribute<Order, Item> lineItems;
    public static volatile SingularAttribute<Order, Address> shippingAddress;
    public static volatile SingularAttribute<Order, BigDecimal> totalCost;

    public static final String LINE_ITEMS = "lineItems";
    public static final String ORDER_ID = "orderId";
    public static final String SHIPPING_ADDRESS = "shippingAddress";
    public static final String TOTAL_COST = "totalCost";
    public static final String CUSTOMER = "customer";
}
----

==== Bootstrapping the Static Metamodel

When the entity manager factory for a persistence unit is created, it is
the responsibility of the persistence provider to initialize the state of
the static metamodel classes representing managed classes belonging to the
persistence unit. Any generated metamodel classes must be accessible on the
classpath.

Persistence providers must support the use of canonical metamodel classes.
Persistence providers may, but are not required to, support the use of
non-canonical metamodel classes.


=== Runtime Access to Metamodel

The interfaces defined in `jakarta.persistence.metamodel` provide for
dynamic access to a metamodel of the persistent state and relationships
of the managed classes of a persistence unit.

An instance of `Metamodel` may be obtained by calling the `getMetamodel()`
method of `EntityManagerFactory` or `EntityManager`.

The complete metamodel API may be found in <<metamodel-api>>.

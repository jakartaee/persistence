== Entities

An entity is a lightweight persistent domain object.

The primary programming artifact is the
entity class. An entity class may make use of auxiliary classes that
serve as helper classes or that are used to represent the state of the
entity.

This chapter describes requirements on entity
classes and instances.

=== The Entity Class [[a18]]

The entity class must be annotated with the
_Entity_ annotation or denoted in the XML descriptor as an entity.

The entity class must have a no-arg
constructor. The entity class may have other constructors as well. The
no-arg constructor must be public or protected.

The entity class must be a top-level class.
An enum or interface must not be designated as an entity.

The entity class must not be final. No
methods or persistent instance variables of the entity class may be
final.

If an entity instance is to be passed by
value as a detached object (e.g., through a remote interface), the
entity class must implement the _Serializable_ interface.

Entities support inheritance, polymorphic
associations, and polymorphic queries.

Both abstract and concrete classes can be
entities. Entities may extend non-entity classes as well as entity
classes, and non-entity classes may extend entity classes.

The persistent state of an entity is
represented by instance variables, which may correspond to JavaBeans
properties. An instance variable must be directly accessed only from
within the methods of the entity by the entity instance itself. Instance
variables must not be accessed by clients of the entity. The state of
the entity is available to clients only through the entity's
methods—i.e., accessor methods (getter/setter methods) or other business
methods.

=== Persistent Fields and Properties

The persistent state of an entity is accessed
by the persistence provider runtimefootnote:[The term "persistence
provider runtime" refers to the runtime environment of the persistence
implementation. In Jakarta EE environments, this may be the Jakarta EE
container or a third-party persistence provider implementation
integrated with it.] either via
JavaBeans style property accessors (“property access”) or via instance
variables (“field access”). Whether persistent properties or persistent
fields or a combination of the two is used for the provider's access to
a given class or entity hierarchy is determined as described in <<a113>>.

Terminology Note: The persistent fields and
properties of an entity class are generically referred to in this
document as the “attributes” of the class.

The instance variables of a class must be
private, protected, or package visibility independent of whether field
access or property access is used. When property access is used, the
property accessor methods must be public or protected.

It is required that the entity class follow
the method signature conventions for JavaBeans read/write properties (as
defined by the JavaBeans Introspector class) for persistent properties
when property access is used.

In this case, for every persistent
property _property_ of type _T_ of the entity, there is a getter method,
_getProperty_, and setter method _setProperty_. For boolean
properties, _isProperty_ may be used as an alternative name for the
getter method.footnote:[Specifically, if get
_X_ is the name of the getter method and set _X_ is the name of the
setter method, where _X_ is a string, the name of the persistent
property is defined by the result of
java.beans.Introspector.decapitalize(_X_).]

For single-valued persistent properties,
these method signatures are:

[source,java]
----
T getProperty()

void setProperty(T t)
----

Collection-valued persistent fields and
properties must be defined in terms of one of the following
collection-valued interfaces regardless of whether the entity class
otherwise adheres to the JavaBeans method conventions noted above and
whether field or property access is used: _java.util.Collection_,
_java.util.Set_, _java.util.List_ footnote:[Portable applications
should not expect the order of a list to be maintained across
persistence contexts unless the _OrderColumn_ construct is used or
unless the _OrderBy_ construct is used and the modifications to the list
observe the specified ordering.],
_java.util.Map_. The collection implementation type may be used by the
application to initialize fields or properties before the entity is made
persistent. Once the entity becomes managed (or detached), subsequent
access must be through the interface type.

Terminology Note: The terms “collection” and
“collection-valued” are used in this specification to denote any of the
above types unless further qualified. In cases where a
_java.util.Collection_ type (or one of its subtypes) is to be
distinguished, the type is identified as such. The terms “map” and “map
collection” are used to apply to a collection of type _java.util.Map_
when a collection of type _java.util.Map_ needs to be distinguished as
such.

For collection-valued persistent properties,
type _T_ must be one of these collection interface types in the method
signatures above. Use of the generic variants of these collection types
is encouraged (for example, _Set<Order>_).

In addition to returning and setting the
persistent state of the instance, property accessor methods may contain
other business logic as well, for example, to perform validation. The
persistence provider runtime executes this logic when property-based
access is used.

Caution should be exercised in adding
business logic to the accessor methods when property access is used. The
order in which the persistence provider runtime calls these methods when
loading or storing persistent state is not defined. Logic contained in
such methods therefore should not rely upon a specific invocation order.

If property access is used and lazy
fetching is specified, portable applications should not directly access
the entity state underlying the property methods of managed instances
until after it has been fetched by the persistence
provider.footnote:[Lazy fetching is a
hint to the persistence provider and can be specified by means of the
_Basic_, _OneToOne_, _OneToMany_, _ManyToOne_, _ManyToMany_, and
_ElementCollection_ annotations and their XML equivalents. See <<a13915>>.]

If a persistence context is joined to a
transaction, runtime exceptions thrown by property accessor methods
cause the current transaction to be marked for rollback; exceptions
thrown by such methods when used by the persistence runtime to load or
store persistent state cause the persistence runtime to mark the current
transaction for rollback and to throw a _PersistenceException_ that
wraps the application exception.

Entity subclasses may override the property
accessor methods. However, portable applications must not override the
object/relational mapping metadata that applies to the persistent fields
or properties of entity superclasses.

The persistent fields or properties of an
entity may be of the following types: Java primitive types,
_java.lang.String_, other Java serializable types (including wrappers
of the primitive types, _java.math.BigInteger_, _java.math.BigDecimal_
, _java.util.Date_, _java.util.Calendarfootnote:[Note that an instance
of Calendar must be fully initialized for the type that it is mapped to.]_,
_java.sql.Date_, _java.sql.Time_, _java.sql.Timestamp_, _byte[]_,
_Byte[]_, _char[]_, _Character[]_, _java.time.LocalDate_,
_java.time.LocalTime_, _java.time.LocalDateTime_,
_java.time.OffsetTime_, _java.time.OffsetDateTime_, and user-defined
types that implement the _Serializable_ interface _)_; enums; entity
types; collections of entity types; embeddable classes (see <<a487>>); collections of
basic and embeddable types (see <<a494>>).

Object/relational mapping metadata may be
specified to customize the object/relational mapping and the loading and
storing of the entity state and relationships. See <<a13915>>.

==== Example

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Customer implements Serializable {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private Address address;
    private Collection<Order> orders = new HashSet();
    private Set<PhoneNumber> phones = new HashSet();

    // No-arg constructor
    public Customer() {}

    @Id // property access is used
    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public Address getAddress() {
        return address;
    }

    public void setAddress(Address address) {
        this.address = address;
    }

    @OneToMany
    public Collection<Order> getOrders() {
        return orders;
    }

    public void setOrders(Collection<Order> orders) {
        this.orders = orders;
    }

    @ManyToMany
    public Set<PhoneNumber> getPhones() {
        return phones;
    }

    public void setPhones(Set<PhoneNumber> phones) {
        this.phones = phones;
    }

    // Business method to add a phone number to the customer
    public void addPhone(PhoneNumber phone) {
        this.getPhones().add(phone);

        // Update the phone entity instance to refer to this customer
        phone.addCustomer(this);
    }
}

=== Access Type [[a113]]

==== Default Access Type

By default, a single access type (field or
property access) applies to an entity hierarchy. The default access type
of an entity hierarchy is determined by the placement of mapping
annotations on the attributes of the entity classes and mapped
superclasses of the entity hierarchy that do not explicitly specify an
access type. An access type is explicitly specified by means of the
_Access_ annotationfootnote:[The use of XML as an
alternative and the interaction between Java language annotations and
XML elements in defining default and explicit access types is described
in <<a16944>>.], as described in <<a122>>.

When annotations are used to define a default
access type, the placement of the mapping annotations on either the
persistent fields or persistent properties of the entity class specifies
the access type as being either field- or property-based access
respectively.

When field-based access is used, the
object/relational mapping annotations for the entity class annotate the
instance variables, and the persistence provider runtime accesses
instance variables directly. All non- _transient_ instance variables
that are not annotated with the _Transient_ annotation are persistent.

When property-based access is used, the
object/relational mapping annotations for the entity class annotate the
getter property accessorsfootnote:[These annotations must
not be applied to the setter methods.], and the persistence
provider runtime accesses persistent state via the property accessor
methods. All properties not annotated with the _Transient_ annotation
are persistent.

Mapping annotations must not be applied to
fields or properties that are _transient_ or _Transient_.

All such classes in the entity hierarchy
whose access type is defaulted in this way must be consistent in their
placement of annotations on either fields or properties, such that a
single, consistent default access type applies within the hierarchy. Any
embeddable classes used by such classes will have the same access type
as the default access type of the hierarchy unless the _Access_
annotation is specified as defined below.

It is an error if a default access type
cannot be determined and an access type is not explicitly specified by
means of annotations or the XML descriptor. The behavior of applications
that mix the placement of annotations on fields and properties within an
entity hierarchy without explicitly specifying the _Access_ annotation
is undefined.

==== Explicit Access Type [[a122]]

An access type for an individual entity
class, mapped superclass, or embeddable class can be specified for that
class independent of the default for the entity hierarchy by means of
the _Access_ annotation applied to the class. This explicit access type
specification does not affect the access type of other entity classes or
mapped superclasses in the entity hierarchy. The following rules apply:

* When _Access(FIELD)_ is applied to an entity
class, mapped superclass, or embeddable class, mapping annotations may
be placed on the instance variables of that class, and the persistence
provider runtime accesses persistent state via the instance variables
defined by the class. All non-transient instance variables that are not
annotated with the _Transient_ annotation are persistent. When
_Access(FIELD)_ is applied to such a class, it is possible to
selectively designate individual attributes within the class for
property access. To specify a persistent property for access by the
persistence provider runtime, that property must be designated
_Access(PROPERTY)_.footnote:[It is permitted (but
redundant) to place Access(FIELD) on a persistent field whose class has
field access type or Access(PROPERTY) on a persistent property whose
class has property access type. It is not permitted to specify a field
as Access(PROPERTY) or a property as Access(FIELD). Note that
Access(PROPERTY) must not be placed on the setter methods.] The behavior is undefined if
mapping annotations are placed on any properties defined by the class
for which _Access(PROPERTY)_ is not specified. Persistent state
inherited from superclasses is accessed in accordance with the access
types of those superclasses.
* When _Access(PROPERTY)_ is applied to an
entity class, mapped superclass, or embeddable class, mapping
annotations may be placed on the properties of that class, and the
persistence provider runtime accesses persistent state via the
properties defined by that class. All properties that are not annotated
with the _Transient_ annotation are persistent. When _Access(PROPERTY)_
is applied to such a class, it is possible to selectively designate
individual attributes within the class for instance variable access. To
specify a persistent instance variable for access by the persistence
provider runtime, that instance variable must be designated
_Access(FIELD)_. The behavior is undefined if mapping annotations are
placed on any instance variables defined by the class for which
_Access(FIELD)_ is not specified. Persistent state inherited from
superclasses is accessed in accordance with the access types of those
superclasses.

Note that when access types are combined
within a class, the _Transient_ annotation should be used to avoid
duplicate persistent mappings.

==== Access Type of an Embeddable Class

The access type of an embeddable class is
determined by the access type of the entity class, mapped superclass, or
embeddable class in which it is embedded (including as a member of an
element collection) independent of whether the access type of the
containing class has been explicitly specified or defaulted. A different
access type for an embeddable class can be specified for that embeddable
class by means of the _Access_ annotation as described above.

==== Defaulted Access Types of Embeddable Classes and Mapped Superclasses

Care must be exercised when defining an
embeddable class or mapped superclass which is used both in a context of
field access and in a context of property access and whose access type
is not explicitly specified by means of the _Access_ annotation or XML
mapping file.

Such classes should be defined so that the
number, names, and types of the resulting persistent attributes are
identical, independent of the access type in use. The behavior of such
classes whose attributes are not independent of access type is otherwise
undefined with regard to use with the metamodel API if they occur in
contexts of differing access types within the same persistence unit.

=== Primary Keys and Entity Identity [[a132]]

Every entity must have a primary key.

The primary key must be defined on the entity
class that is the root of the entity hierarchy or on a mapped superclass
that is a (direct or indirect) superclass of all entity classes in the
entity hierarchy. The primary key must be defined exactly once in an
entity hierarchy.

* A primary key corresponds to one or more
fields or properties (“attributes”) of the entity class.
* A simple (i.e., non-composite) primary key
must correspond to a single persistent field or property of the entity
class. The _Id_ annotation or _id_ XML element must be used to denote a
simple primary key. See <<a14827>>.
* A composite primary key must correspond to
either a single persistent field or property or to a set of such fields
or properties as described below. A primary key class must be defined to
represent a composite primary key. Composite primary keys typically
arise when mapping from legacy databases when the database key is
comprised of several columns. The _EmbeddedId_ or _IdClass_ annotation
is used to denote a composite primary key. See <<a14687>> and <<a14836>>.

A simple primary key or a field or property
of a composite primary key should be one of the following types: any
Java primitive type; any primitive wrapper type; _java.lang.String_;
_java.util.Date_; _java.sql.Date_; _java.math.BigDecimal_;
_java.math.BigInteger_.footnote:[In general, however,
approximate numeric types (e.g., floating point types) should never be
used in primary keys.] If the primary key is a
composite primary key derived from the primary key of another entity,
the primary key may contain an attribute whose type is that of the
primary key of the referenced entity as described in <<a149>>.
Entities whose primary keys use types other than these will
not be portable. If generated primary keys are used, only integral types
will be portable. If _java.util.Date_ is used as a primary key field or
property, the temporal type should be specified as _DATE_.

The following rules apply for composite
primary keys:

- The primary key class must be public and must
have a public no-arg constructor.

- The access type (field- or property-based
access) of a primary key class is determined by the access type of the
entity for which it is the primary key unless the primary key is a
embedded id and a different access type is specified. See Section <<a113>>.

- If property-based access is used, the
properties of the primary key class must be public or protected.

- The primary key class must be serializable.

- The primary key class must define _equals_
and _hashCode_ methods. The semantics of value equality for these
methods must be consistent with the database equality for the database
types to which the key is mapped.

- A composite primary key must either be
represented and mapped as an embeddable class (see <<a14687>>) or must be
represented as an id class and mapped to multiple fields or properties
of the entity class (see <<a14836>>).

- If the composite primary key class is
represented as an id class, the names of primary key fields or
properties in the primary key class and those of the entity class to
which the id class is mapped must correspond and their types must be the
same.

- A primary key that corresponds to a derived
identity must conform to the rules of <<a149>>.

The value of its primary key uniquely
identifies an entity instance within a persistence context and to
_EntityManager_ operations as described in
<<a1060>>. The application must
not change the value of the primary keyfootnote:[This includes not
changing the value of a mutable type that is primary key or an attribute
of a composite primary key.]. The
behavior is undefined if this occurs.footnote:[The implementation
may, but is not required to, throw an exception. Portable applications
must not rely on any such specific behavior.]

==== Primary Keys Corresponding to Derived Identities [[a149]]

The identity of an entity may be derived from
the identity of another entity (the “parent” entity) when the former
entity (the “dependent” entity) is the owner of a many-to-one or
one-to-one relationship to the parent entity and a foreign key maps the
relationship from dependent to parent.

If a many-to-one or one-to-one entity
relationship corresponds to a primary key attribute, the entity
containing this relationship cannot be persisted without the
relationship having been assigned an entity since the identity of the
entity containing the relationship is derived from the referenced
entity.footnote:[If the application
does not set the primary key attribute corresponding to the
relationship, the value of that attribute may not be available until
after the entity has been flushed to the database.]

Derived identities may be captured by means
of simple primary keys or by means of composite primary keys as
described in <<a155>> below.

If the dependent entity class has primary key
attributes in addition to those corresponding to the parent's primary
key or if the parent has a composite primary key, an embedded id or id
class must be used to specify the primary key of the dependent entity.
It is not necessary that parent entity and dependent entity both use
embedded ids or both use id classes to represent composite primary keys
when the parent has a composite key.

A dependent entity may have more than one
parent entity.

===== Specification of Derived Identities [[a155]]

If the dependent entity uses an id class to
represent its primary key, one of the two following rules must be
observed:

* The names of the attributes of the id class
and the _Id_ attributes of the dependent entity class must correspond as
follows:

** The _Id_ attribute in the entity class and
the corresponding attribute in the id class must have the same name.

** If an _Id_ attribute in the entity class is
of basic type, the corresponding attribute in the id class must have the
same type.

** If an _Id_ attribute in the entity is a
many-to-one or one-to-one relationship to a parent entity, the
corresponding attribute in the id class must be of the same Java type as
the id class or embedded id of the parent entity (if the parent entity
has a composite primary key) or the type of the _Id_ attribute of the
parent entity (if the parent entity has a simple primary key).

* If the dependent entity has a single
primary key attribute (i.e., the relationship attribute), the id class
specified by the dependent entity must be the same as the primary key
class of the parent entity. The _Id_ annotation is applied to the
relationship to the parent entity.footnote:[Note that it is
correct to observe the first rule as an alternative in this case.]

If the dependent entity uses an
embedded id to represent its primary key, the attribute in the embedded
id corresponding to the relationship attribute must be of the same type
as the primary key of the parent entity and must be designated by the
_MapsId_ annotation applied to the relationship attribute. The _value_
element of the _MapsId_ annotation must be used to specify the name of
the attribute within the embedded id to which the relationship attribute
corresponds. If the embedded id of the dependent entity is of the same
Java type as the primary key of the parent entity, the relationship
attribute maps both the relationship to the parent and the primary key
of the dependent entity, and in this case the _MapsId_ annotation is
specified without the _value_ element.footnote:[Note that the
parent's primary key might be represented as either an embedded id or as
an id class.]

If the dependent entity has a single primary
key attribute (i.e, the relationship attribute or an attribute that
corresponds to the relationship attribute) and the primary key of the
parent entity is a simple primary key, the primary key of the dependent
entity is a simple primary key of the same type as that of the parent
entity (and neither _EmbeddedId_ nor _IdClass_ is specified). In this
case, either (1) the relationship attribute is annotated _Id_, or (2) a
separate _Id_ attribute is specified and the relationship attribute is
annotated _MapsId_ (and the _value_ element of the _MapsId_ annotation
is not specified).

===== Mapping of Derived Identities

A primary key attribute that is derived from
the identity of a parent entity is mapped by the corresponding
relationship attribute. The default mapping for this relationship is as
specified in <<a538>>. In the case where a default mapping does not apply or
where a default mapping is to be overridden, the _JoinColumn_ or
_JoinColumns_ annotation is used on the relationship attribute.

If the dependent entity uses an embedded id
to represent its primary key, the _AttributeOverride_ annotation may be
used to override the default mapping of embedded id attributes that do
not correspond to the relationship attributes mapping the derived
identity. The embedded id attributes that correspond to the relationship
are treated by the provider as “read only”—that is, any updates to them
on the part of the application are not propagated to the database.

If the dependent uses an id class, the
_Column_ annotation may be used to override the default mapping of _Id_
attributes that are not relationship attributes.

===== Examples of Derived Identities

*Example 1:*

The parent entity has a simple primary key:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id long empId;
    String empName;

    // ...
}
----

*Case (a):* The dependent entity uses _IdClass_ to represent a composite key:

[source,java]
----
public class DependentId {
    String name; // matches name of @Id attribute
    long emp; // matches name of @Id attribute and type of Employee PK
}

@Entity
@IdClass(DependentId.class)
public class Dependent {
    @Id String name;

    // id attribute mapped by join column default
    @Id @ManyToOne
    Employee emp;

    // ...
}
----

Sample query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT d
FROM Dependent d
WHERE d.name = 'Joe' AND d.emp.empName = 'Sam'
----

*Case(b):* The dependent entity uses _EmbeddedId_ to represent a composite key:

[source,java]
----
@Embeddable
public class DependentId {
    String name;
    long empPK; // corresponds to PK type of Employee
}

@Entity
public class Dependent {
    @EmbeddedId DependentId id;

    // id attribute mapped by join column default
    @MapsId("empPK") // maps empPK attribute of embedded id
    @ManyToOne
    Employee emp;

    // ...
}
----

Sample query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT d
FROM Dependent d
WHERE d.id.name = 'Joe' AND d.emp.empName = 'Sam'
----

*Example 2:*

The parent entity uses _IdClass_:

[source,java]
----
public class EmployeeId {
    String firstName;
    String lastName;

    // ...
}

@Entity
@IdClass(EmployeeId.class)
public class Employee {
    @Id String firstName
    @Id String lastName

   // ...
}
----

*Case (a):* The dependent entity uses _IdClass_:

[source,java]
----
public class DependentId {
    String name; // matches name of attribute
    EmployeeId emp; //matches name of attribute and type of Employee PK
}

@Entity
@IdClass(DependentId.class)
public class Dependent {
    @Id
    String name;

    @Id
    @JoinColumns({
        @JoinColumn(name="FK1", referencedColumnName="firstName"),
        @JoinColumn(name="FK2", referencedColumnName="lastName")
    })

    @ManyToOne
    Employee emp;
}
----

Sample query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT d
FROM Dependent d
WHERE d.name = 'Joe' AND d.emp.firstName = 'Sam'
----

*Case (b):* The dependent entity uses
_EmbeddedId_. The type of the _empPK_ attribute is the same as that of
the primary key of _Employee_. The _EmployeeId_ class needs to be
annotated _Embeddable_ or denoted as an embeddable class in the XML
descriptor.

[source,java]
----
@Embeddable
public class DependentId {
    String name;
    EmployeeId empPK;
}

@Entity
public class Dependent {
    @EmbeddedId
    DependentId id;

    @MapsId("empPK")
    @JoinColumns({
        @JoinColumn(name="FK1", referencedColumnName="firstName"),
        @JoinColumn(name="FK2", referencedColumnName="lastName")
    })

    @ManyToOne
    Employee emp;

    // ...
}
----

Sample query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT d
FROM Dependent d
WHERE d.id.name = 'Joe' AND d.emp.firstName = 'Sam'
----

Note that the following alternative query
will yield the same result:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT d
FROM Dependent d
WHERE d.id.name = 'Joe' AND d.id.empPK.firstName = 'Sam'
----

*Example 3:*

The parent entity uses _EmbeddedId_:

[source,java]
----
@Embeddable
public class EmployeeId {
    String firstName;
    String lastName;

    // ...
}

@Entity
public class Employee {
    @EmbeddedId
    EmployeeId empId;

    // ...
}
----

*Case (a):* The dependent entity uses _IdClass_:

[source,java]
----
public class DependentId {
    String name; // matches name of @Id attribute
    EmployeeId emp; // matches name of @Id attribute and type of embedded id of Employee
}

@Entity
@IdClass(DependentId.class)
public class Dependent {
    @Id
    @Column(name="dep_name") // default column name is overridden
    String name;

    @Id
    @JoinColumns({
        @JoinColumn(name="FK1", referencedColumnName="firstName"),
        @JoinColumn(name="FK2", referencedColumnName="lastName")
    })

    @ManyToOne Employee
    emp;
}
----

Sample query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT d
FROM Dependent d
WHERE d.name = 'Joe' and d.emp.empId.firstName = 'Sam'
----

*Case (b):* The dependent entity uses _EmbeddedId_:

[source,java]
----
@Embeddable
public class DependentId {
    String name;
    EmployeeId empPK; // corresponds to PK type of Employee
}

@Entity
public class Dependent {
    // default column name for "name" attribute is overridden
    @AttributeOverride(name="name", column=@Column(name="dep_name"))
    @EmbeddedId DependentId id;

    @MapsId("empPK")
    @JoinColumns({
        @JoinColumn(name="FK1", referencedColumnName="firstName"),
        @JoinColumn(name="FK2", referencedColumnName="lastName")
    })
    @ManyToOne
    Employee emp;

    // ...
}
----

Sample query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT d
FROM Dependent d
WHERE d.id.name = 'Joe' and d.emp.empId.firstName = 'Sam'
----

Note that the following alternative query will yield the same result:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT d
FROM Dependent d
WHERE d.id.name = 'Joe' AND d.id.empPK.firstName = 'Sam'
----

*Example 4:*

The parent entity has a simple primary key:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {
    @Id
    String ssn;

    // ...
}
----

*Case (a):* The dependent entity has a
single primary key attribute which is mapped by the relationship
attribute. The primary key of _MedicalHistory_ is of type _String_.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class MedicalHistory {
    // default join column name is overridden
    @Id
    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name="FK")
    Person patient;

    // ...
}
----

Sample query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT m
FROM MedicalHistory m
WHERE m.patient.ssn = '123-45-6789'
----

*Case (b):* The dependent entity has
a single primary key attribute corresponding to the relationship
attribute. The primary key attribute is of the same basic type as the
primary key of the parent entity. The _MapsId_ annotation applied to the
relationship attribute indicates that the primary key is mapped by the
relationship attribute.footnote:[Note that the use of
PrimaryKeyJoinColumn instead of MapsId would result in the same mapping
in this example. Use of MapsId is preferred for the mapping of derived
identities.]

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class MedicalHistory {
    @Id
    String id; // overriding not allowed

    // ...

    // default join column name is overridden
    @MapsId
    @JoinColumn(name="FK")
    @OneToOne
    Person patient;

    // ...
}
----

Sample query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT m
FROM MedicalHistory m WHERE m.patient.ssn = '123-45-6789'
----

*Example 5:*

The parent entity uses _IdClass_. The
dependent's primary key class is of same type as that of the parent
entity.

[source,java]
----
public class PersonId {
    String firstName;
    String lastName;

@Entity
@IdClass(PersonId.class)
public class Person {
    @Id
    String firstName;

    @Id
    String lastName;

    // ...

----

*Case (a):* The dependent entity uses _IdClass_:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@IdClass(PersonId.class)
public class MedicalHistory {
    @Id
    @JoinColumns({
        @JoinColumn(name="FK1", referencedColumnName="firstName"),
        @JoinColumn(name="FK2", referencedColumnName="lastName")

    @OneToOne
    Person patient;

    // ...

----

Sample query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT m
FROM MedicalHistory m
WHERE m.patient.firstName = 'Charles'
----

*Case (b):* The dependent entity uses the
_EmbeddedId_ and _MapsId_ annotations. The _PersonId_ class needs to be
annotated _Embeddable_ or denoted as an embeddable class in the XML
descriptor.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class MedicalHistory {
    // all attributes map to relationship:
    AttributeOverride not allowed

=== Basic Type

Basic type is any Java primitive type, wrapper of the primitive types, java.lang.String,
java.math.BigInteger, java.math.BigDecimal, java.util.Date, java.util.Calendar, java.sql.Date,
java.sql.Time, java.sql.Timestamp, java.time.LocalDate, java.time.LocalTime,
java.time.LocalDateTime, java.time.OffsetTime, java.time.OffsetDateTime, byte[], Byte[], char[],
Character[], enum, any other type that implements Serializable.

=== Embeddable Classes [[a487]]

An entity may use other fine-grained classes
to represent entity state. Instances of these classes, unlike entity
instances, do not have persistent identity of their own. Instead, they
exist only as part of the state of the entity to which they belong. An
entity may have collections of embeddables as well as single-valued
embeddable attributes. Embeddables may also be used as map keys and map
values. Embedded objects belong strictly to their owning entity, and are
not sharable across persistent entities. Attempting to share an embedded
object across entities has undefined semantics.

Embeddable classes must adhere to the
requirements specified in <<a18>> for entities with the exception that embeddable classes
are not annotated as _Entity_. Embeddable classes must be annotated as
_Embeddable_ or denoted in the XML descriptor as such. The access type
for an embedded object is determined as described in <<a113>>.

An embeddable class may be used to represent
the state of another embeddable class.

An embeddable class (including an
embeddable class within another embeddable class) may contain a
collection of a basic type or other embeddable
class.footnote:[Direct or indirect
circular containment dependencies among embeddable classes are not
permitted.]

An embeddable class may contain a
relationship to an entity or collection of entities. Since instances of
embeddable classes themselves have no persistent identity, the
relationship _from_ the referenced entity is to the _entity_ that
contains the embeddable instance(s) and not to the embeddable
itself.footnote:[An entity cannot have
a unidirectional relationship to the embeddable class of another entity
(or itself).] An embeddable class that is used as an
embedded id or as a map key must not contain such a relationship.

Additional requirements and restrictions on
embeddable classes are described in <<a494>>.

=== Collections of Embeddable Classes and Basic Types [[a494]]

A persistent field or property of an entity
or embeddable class may correspond to a collection of a basic type or
embeddable class (“element collection”). Such a collection, when
specified as such by the _ElementCollection_ annotation, is mapped by
means of a collection table, as defined in <<a14250>>. If the
_ElementCollection_ annotation (or XML equivalent) is not specified for
the collection-valued field or property, the rules of <<a511>> apply.

An embeddable class (including an embeddable
class within another embeddable class) that is contained within an
element collection must not contain an element collection, nor may it
contain a relationship to an entity other than a many-to-one or
one-to-one relationship. The embeddable class must be on the owning side
of such a relationship and the relationship must be mapped by a foreign
key mapping. (See <<a516>>)

=== Map Collections

Collections of elements and entity
relationships can be represented as _java.util.Map_ collections.

The map key and the map value independently
can each be a basic type, an embeddable class, or an entity.

The _ElementCollection_, _OneToMany_, and
_ManyToMany_ annotations are used to specify the map as an element
collection or entity relationship as follows: when the map value is a
basic type or embeddable class, the _ElementCollection_ annotation is
used; when the map value is an entity, the _OneToMany_ or _ManyToMany_
annotation is used.

Bidirectional relationships represented as
_java.util.Map_ collections support the use of the _Map_ datatype on one
side of the relationship only.

==== Map Keys

If the map key type is a basic type, the
_MapKeyColumn_ annotation can be used to specify the column mapping for
the map key. If the _MapKeyColumn_ annotation is not specified, the
default values of the _MapKeyColumn_ annotation apply as described in <<a15367>>.

If the map key type is an embeddable class,
the mappings for the map key columns are defaulted according to the
default column mappings for the embeddable class. (See <<a14330>>). The
_AttributeOverride_ and _AttributeOverrides_ annotations can be used to
override these mappings, as described in <<a14084>> and <<a14178>>. If an
embeddable class is used as a map key, the embeddable class must
implement the _hashCode_ and _equals_ methods consistently with the
database columns to which the embeddable is
mappedfootnote:[Note that when an
embeddable instance is used as a map key, these attributes represent its
identity. Changes to embeddable instances used as map keys have
undefined behaviour and should be avoided.].

If the map key type is an entity, the
_MapKeyJoinColumn_ and _MapKeyJoinColumns_ annotations are used to
specify the column mappings for the map key. If the primary key of the
referenced entity is a simple primary key and the _MapKeyJoinColumn_
annotation is not specified, the default values of the
_MapKeyJoinColumn_ annotation apply as described in <<a15450>>.

If Java generic types are not used in the
declaration of a relationship attribute of type _java.util.Map_, the
_MapKeyClass_ annotation must be used to specify the type of the key of
the map.

The _MapKey_ annotation is used to specify
the special case where the map key is itself the primary key or a
persistent field or property of the entity that is the value of the map.
The _MapKeyClass_ annotation is not used when _MapKey_ is specified.

==== Map Values

When the value type of the map is a basic
type or an embeddable class, a collection table is used to map the map.
If Java generic types are not used, the _targetClass_ element of the
_ElementCollection_ annotation must be used to specify the value type
for the map. The default column mappings for the map value are derived
according to the default mapping rules for the _CollectionTable_
annotation defined in <<a14250>>. The _Column_ annotation is used to override
these defaults for a map value of basic type. The _AttributeOverride(s)_ and _AssociationOverride(s)_ annotations are used to override
the mappings for a map value that is an embeddable class.

When the value type of the map is an entity,
a join table is used to map the map for a many-to-many relationship or,
by default, for a one-to-many unidirectional relationship. If the
relationship is a bidirectional one-to-many/many-to-one relationship, by
default the map is mapped in the table of the entity that is the value
of the map. If Java generic types are not used, the _targetEntity_
element of the _OneToMany_ or _ManyToMany_ annotation must be used to
specify the value type for the map. Default mappings are described in
<<a538>>.

=== Mapping Defaults for Non-Relationship Fields or Properties [[a511]]

If a persistent field or property other than
a relationship property is _not_ annotated with one of the mapping
annotations defined in <<a13915>> (or equivalent mapping information is not
specified in the XML descriptor), the following default mapping rules
are applied in order:

* If the type is a class that is annotated with
the _Embeddable_ annotation, it is mapped in the same way as if the
field or property were annotated with the _Embedded_ annotation. See
<<a14634>> and <<a14672>>.
* If the type of the field or property is one
of the following, it is mapped in the same way as it would if it were
annotated as _Basic_: Java primitive types, wrappers of the primitive
types, _java.lang.String_, _java.math.BigInteger_,
_java.math.BigDecimal_, _java.util.Date_, _java.util.Calendar_,
_java.sql.Date_, _java.sql.Time_, _java.sql.Timestamp_,
_java.time.LocalDate_, _java.time.LocalTime_,
_java.time.LocalDateTime_, _java.time.OffsetTime_,
_java.time.OffsetDateTime_, _byte[]_, _Byte[]_, _char[]_,
_Character[]_, enums, any other type that implements _Serializable_.
See <<a14205>>, <<a14719>>, <<a15087>>, and <<a16361>>.

It is an error if no annotation is present
and none of the above rules apply.

=== Entity Relationships [[a516]]

Relationships among entities may be
one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many. Relationships are
polymorphic.

If there is an association between two
entities, one of the following relationship modeling annotations must be
applied to the corresponding persistent property or field of the
referencing entity: _OneToOne_, _OneToMany_, _ManyToOne_,
_ManyToMany_. For associations that do not specify the target type
(e.g., where Java generic types are not used for collections), it is
necessary to specify the entity that is the target of the
relationship.footnote:[For associations of
type _java.util.Map_, _target type_ refers to the type that is the Map
_value_.] Equivalent XML elements may be used
as an alternative to these mapping annotations.

_These annotations mirror common practice in
relational database schema modeling. The use of the relationship
modeling annotations allows the object/relationship mapping of
associations to the relational database schema to be fully defaulted, to
provide an ease-of-development facility. This is described in <<a538>>._

Relationships may be bidirectional or
unidirectional. A bidirectional relationship has both an owning side and
an inverse (non-owning) side. A unidirectional relationship has only an
owning side. The owning side of a relationship determines the updates to
the relationship in the database, as described in <<a1955>>.

The following rules apply to bidirectional
relationships:

The inverse side of a bidirectional
relationship must refer to its owning side by use of the _mappedBy_
element of the _OneToOne_, _OneToMany_, or _ManyToMany_ annotation.
The _mappedBy_ element designates the property or field in the entity
that is the owner of the relationship.

* The many side of one-to-many / many-to-one
bidirectional relationships must be the owning side, hence the
_mappedBy_ element cannot be specified on the _ManyToOne_ annotation.
* For one-to-one bidirectional relationships,
the owning side corresponds to the side that contains the corresponding
foreign key.
* For many-to-many bidirectional relationships
either side may be the owning side.

The relationship modeling annotation
constrains the use of the _cascade=REMOVE_ specification. The
_cascade=REMOVE_ specification should only be applied to associations
that are specified as _OneToOne_ or _OneToMany_. Applications that
apply _cascade=REMOVE_ to other associations are not portable.

Associations that are specified as _OneToOne_
or _OneToMany_ support use of the _orphanRemoval_ option. The following
behaviors apply when _orphanRemoval_ is in effect:

* If an entity that is the target of the
relationship is removed from the relationship (by setting the
relationship to null or removing the entity from the relationship
collection), the remove operation will be applied to the entity being
orphaned. The remove operation is applied at the time of the flush
operation. The _orphanRemoval_ functionality is intended for entities
that are privately “owned” by their parent entity. Portable applications
must otherwise not depend upon a specific order of removal, and must not
reassign an entity that has been orphaned to another relationship or
otherwise attempt to persist it. If the entity being orphaned is a
detached, new, or removed entity, the semantics of _orphanRemoval_ do
not apply.
* If the remove operation is applied to a
managed source entity, the remove operation will be cascaded to the
relationship target in accordance with the rules of <<a1946>>,
(and hence it is not necessary to specify _cascade=REMOVE_ for the
relationship)footnote:[If the parent is
detached or new or was previously removed before the orphan was
associated with it, the remove operation is not applied to the entity
being orphaned.].

<<a538>>, defines relationship mapping defaults
for entity relationships. Additional mapping annotations (e.g., column
and table mapping annotations) may be specified to override or further
refine the default mappings and mapping strategies described in <<a538>>.

In addition, this specification also requires
support for the following alternative mapping strategies:

* The mapping of unidirectional one-to-many
relationships by means of foreign key mappings. The _JoinColumn_
annotation or corresponding XML element must be used to specify such
non-default mappings. See <<a14922>>.
* The mapping of unidirectional and
bidirectional one-to-one relationships, bidirectional
many-to-one/one-to-many relationships, and unidirectional many-to-one
relationships by means of join table mappings. The _JoinTable_
annotation or corresponding XML element must be used to specify such
non-default mappings. See <<a15022>>.

Such mapping annotations must be specified on
the owning side of the relationship. Any overriding of mapping defaults
must be consistent with the relationship modeling annotation that is
specified. For example, if a many-to-one relationship mapping is
specified, it is not permitted to specify a unique key constraint on the
foreign key for the relationship.

The persistence provider handles the
object/relational mapping of the relationships, including their loading
and storing to the database as specified in the metadata of the entity
class, and the referential integrity of the relationships as specified
in the database (e.g., by foreign key constraints).

[NOTE]
====
Note that it is the application that bears
responsibility for maintaining the consistency of runtime
relationships—for example, for insuring that the “one” and the “many”
sides of a bidirectional relationship are consistent with one another
when the application updates the relationship at runtime.
====

If there are no associated entities for a
multi-valued relationship of an entity fetched from the database, the
persistence provider is responsible for returning an empty collection as
the value of the relationship.

=== Relationship Mapping Defaults [[a538]]

This section defines the mapping defaults
that apply to the use of the _OneToOne_, _OneToMany_, _ManyToOne_,
and _ManyToMany_ relationship modeling annotations. The same mapping
defaults apply when the XML descriptor is used to denote the
relationship cardinalities.

==== Bidirectional OneToOne Relationships

Assuming that:

* Entity A references a single instance of Entity B.
* Entity B references a single instance of Entity A.
* Entity A is specified as the owner of the relationship.

The following mapping defaults apply:

* Entity A is mapped to a table named _A_.
* Entity B is mapped to a table named _B_.
* Table _A_ contains a foreign key to table _B_.
The foreign key column name is formed as the concatenation of the
following: the name of the relationship property or field of entity A; "
___ "; the name of the primary key column in table _B_. The foreign key
column has the same type as the primary key of table _B_ and there is a
unique key constraint on it.

*Example:*

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Employee {
    private Cubicle assignedCubicle;

    @OneToOne
    public Cubicle getAssignedCubicle() {
        return assignedCubicle;
    }

    public void setAssignedCubicle(Cubicle cubicle) {
        this.assignedCubicle = cubicle;
    }

    // ...
}

@Entity
public class Cubicle {
    private Employee residentEmployee;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy="assignedCubicle")
    public Employee getResidentEmployee() {
        return residentEmployee;
    }

    public void setResidentEmployee(Employee employee) {
        this.residentEmployee = employee;
    }

    // ...
}
----

In this example:

* Entity _Employee_ references a single instance of Entity _Cubicle_.
* Entity _Cubicle_ references a single instance of Entity _Employee_.
* Entity _Employee_ is the owner of the relationship.

The following mapping defaults apply:

* Entity _Employee_ is mapped to a table named _EMPLOYEE_.
* Entity _Cubicle_ is mapped to a table named _CUBICLE_.
* Table _EMPLOYEE_ contains a foreign key to
table _CUBICLE_. The foreign key column is named _ASSIGNEDCUBICLE__ <PK
of CUBICLE>, where <PK of CUBICLE> denotes the name of the primary key
column of table _CUBICLE_. The foreign key column has the same type as
the primary key of _CUBICLE_, and there is a unique key constraint on
it.

==== Bidirectional ManyToOne / OneToMany Relationships

Assuming that:

* Entity A references a single instance of Entity B.
* Entity B references a collection of Entity Afootnote:[When the relationship
is modeled as a _java.util.Map_, “Entity B references a collection of
Entity A” means that Entity B references a map collection in which the
type of the Map _value_ is Entity A. The map key may be a basic type,
embeddable class, or an entity.
].
* Entity A must be the owner of the relationship.

The following mapping defaults apply:

* Entity A is mapped to a table named _A_.
* Entity B is mapped to a table named _B_.
* Table _A_ contains a foreign key to table _B_.
The foreign key column name is formed as the concatenation of the
following: the name of the relationship property or field of entity A; "
___ "; the name of the primary key column in table _B_. The foreign key
column has the same type as the primary key of table _B_.

*Example:*

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Employee {
    private Department department;

    @ManyToOne
    public Department getDepartment() {
        return department;
    }

    public void setDepartment(Department department) {
        this.department = department;
    }

    // ...
}

@Entity
public class Department {
    private Collection<Employee> employees = new HashSet();

    @OneToMany(mappedBy="department")
    public Collection<Employee> getEmployees() {
        return employees;
    }

    public void setEmployees(Collection<Employee> employees) {
        this.employees = employees;
    }

    // ...
}
----

In this example:

* Entity _Employee_ references a single instance of Entity _Department_.
* Entity _Department_ references a collection of Entity _Employee_.
* Entity _Employee_ is the owner of the relationship.

The following mapping defaults apply:

* Entity _Employee_ is mapped to a table named _EMPLOYEE_.
* Entity _Department_ is mapped to a table named _DEPARTMENT_.
* Table _EMPLOYEE_ contains a foreign key to
table _DEPARTMENT_. The foreign key column is named _DEPARTMENT__ <PK
of DEPARTMENT>, where <PK of DEPARTMENT> denotes the name of the primary
key column of table _DEPARTMENT_. The foreign key column has the same
type as the primary key of _DEPARTMENT_.

==== Unidirectional Single-Valued Relationships

Assuming that:

* Entity A references a single instance of Entity B.
* Entity B does not reference Entity A.

A unidirectional relationship has only an owning side, which in this case must be Entity A.

The unidirectional single-valued relationship
modeling case can be specified as either a unidirectional _OneToOne_ or
as a unidirectional _ManyToOne_ relationship.

===== Unidirectional OneToOne Relationships [[a640]]

The following mapping defaults apply:

* Entity A is mapped to a table named _A_.
* Entity B is mapped to a table named _B_.
* Table _A_ contains a foreign key to table _B_.
The foreign key column name is formed as the concatenation of the
following: the name of the relationship property or field of entity A; "
___ "; the name of the primary key column in table _B_. The foreign key
column has the same type as the primary key of table _B_ and there is a
unique key constraint on it.

*Example:*

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Employee {
    private TravelProfile profile;

    @OneToOne
    public TravelProfile getProfile() {
        return profile;
    }

    public void setProfile(TravelProfile profile) {
        this.profile = profile;
    }

    // ...
}

@Entity
public class TravelProfile {
    // ...
}
----

In this example:

* Entity _Employee_ references a single instance of Entity _TravelProfile_.
* Entity _TravelProfile_ does not reference Entity _Employee_.
* Entity _Employee_ is the owner of the relationship.

The following mapping defaults apply:

* Entity _Employee_ is mapped to a table named _EMPLOYEE_.
* Entity _TravelProfile_ is mapped to a table named _TRAVELPROFILE_.
* Table _EMPLOYEE_ contains a foreign key to
table _TRAVELPROFILE_. The foreign key column is named _PROFILE__ <PK
of TRAVELPROFILE>, where <PK of TRAVELPROFILE> denotes the name of the
primary key column of table _TRAVELPROFILE_. The foreign key column has
the same type as the primary key of _TRAVELPROFILE_, and there is a
unique key constraint on it.

===== Unidirectional ManyToOne Relationships

The following mapping defaults apply:

* Entity A is mapped to a table named _A_.
* Entity B is mapped to a table named _B_.
* Table _A_ contains a foreign key to table _B_. The foreign key column name is formed as the concatenation of the following: the name of the relationship property or field of entity A; "_"; the name of the primary key column in table _B_. The foreign key column has the same type as the primary key of table _B_.

*Example:*

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Employee {
    private Address address;

    @ManyToOne
    public Address getAddress() {
        return address;
    }

    public void setAddress(Address address) {
        this.address = address;
    }

    // ...
}

@Entity
public class Address {
    // ...
}
----

In this example:

* Entity _Employee_ references a single instance of Entity _Address_.
* Entity _Address_ does not reference Entity _Employee_.
* Entity _Employee_ is the owner of the relationship.

The following mapping defaults apply:

* Entity _Employee_ is mapped to a table named _EMPLOYEE_.
* Entity _Address_ is mapped to a table named _ADDRESS_.
* Table _EMPLOYEE_ contains a foreign key to
table _ADDRESS_. The foreign key column is named _ADDRESS__ <PK of
ADDRESS>, where <PK of ADDRESS> denotes the name of the primary key
column of table _ADDRESS_. The foreign key column has the same type as
the primary key of _ADDRESS_.

==== Bidirectional ManyToMany Relationships [[a708]]

Assuming that:

* Entity A references a collection of Entity B.
* Entity B references a collection of Entity A.
* Entity A is the owner of the relationship.

The following mapping defaults apply:

* Entity A is mapped to a table named _A_.
* Entity B is mapped to a table named _B_.
* There is a join table that is named _A_B_
(owner name first). This join table has two foreign key columns. One
foreign key column refers to table _A_ and has the same type as the
primary key of table _A_. The name of this foreign key column is formed
as the concatenation of the following: the name of the relationship
property or field of entity B; " ___ "; the name of the primary key
column in table _A_. The other foreign key column refers to table _B_
and has the same type as the primary key of table _B_. The name of this
foreign key column is formed as the concatenation of the following: the
name of the relationship property or field of entity A; " ___ "; the
name of the primary key column in table _B_.

*Example:*

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Project {
    private Collection<Employee> employees;

    @ManyToMany
    public Collection<Employee> getEmployees() {
        return employees;
    }

    public void setEmployees(Collection<Employee> employees) {
        this.employees = employees;
    }

    // ...
}

@Entity
public class Employee {
    private Collection<Project> projects;

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy="employees")
    public Collection<Project> getProjects() {
        return projects;
    }

    public void setProjects(Collection<Project> projects) {
        this.projects = projects;
    }

    // ...
}
----

In this example:

* Entity _Project_ references a collection of Entity _Employee_.
* Entity _Employee_ references a collection of Entity _Project_.
* Entity _Project_ is the owner of the relationship.

The following mapping defaults apply:

* Entity _Project_ is mapped to a table named _PROJECT_.
* Entity _Employee_ is mapped to a table named _EMPLOYEE_.
* There is a join table that is named
_PROJECT_EMPLOYEE_ (owner name first). This join table has two foreign
key columns. One foreign key column refers to table _PROJECT_ and has
the same type as the primary key of _PROJECT_. The name of this foreign
key column is _PROJECTS__ <PK of PROJECT>, where <PK of PROJECT> denotes
the name of the primary key column of table _PROJECT_. The other
foreign key column refers to table _EMPLOYEE_ and has the same type as
the primary key of _EMPLOYEE_. The name of this foreign key column is
_EMPLOYEES__ <PK of EMPLOYEE>, where <PK of EMPLOYEE> denotes the name
of the primary key column of table _EMPLOYEE_.

==== Unidirectional Multi-Valued Relationships [[a758]]

Assuming that:

* Entity A references a collection of Entity B.
* Entity B does not reference Entity A.

A unidirectional relationship has only an owning side, which in this case must be Entity A.

The unidirectional multi-valued relationship
modeling case can be specified as either a unidirectional _OneToMany_ or
as a unidirectional _ManyToMany_ relationship.

===== Unidirectional OneToMany Relationships [[a764]]

The following mapping defaults apply:

* Entity A is mapped to a table named _A_.
* Entity B is mapped to a table named _B_.
* There is a join table that is named _A_B_
(owner name first). This join table has two foreign key columns. One
foreign key column refers to table _A_ and has the same type as the
primary key of table _A_. The name of this foreign key column is formed
as the concatenation of the following: the name of entity A; " ___ ";
the name of the primary key column in table _A_. The other foreign key
column refers to table _B_ and has the same type as the primary key of
table _B_ and there is a unique key constraint on it. The name of this
foreign key column is formed as the concatenation of the following: the
name of the relationship property or field of entity A; " ___ "; the
name of the primary key column in table _B_.

*Example:*

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Employee {
    private Collection<AnnualReview> annualReviews;

    @OneToMany
    public Collection<AnnualReview> getAnnualReviews() {
        return annualReviews;
    }

    public void setAnnualReviews(Collection<AnnualReview> annualReviews) {
        this.annualReviews = annualReviews;
    }

    // ...
}

@Entity
public class AnnualReview {
    // ...
}
----

In this example:

* Entity _Employee_ references a collection of Entity _AnnualReview_.
* Entity _AnnualReview_ does not reference Entity _Employee_.
* Entity _Employee_ is the owner of the relationship.

The following mapping defaults apply:

* Entity _Employee_ is mapped to a table named _EMPLOYEE_.
* Entity _AnnualReview_ is mapped to a table named _ANNUALREVIEW_.
* There is a join table that is named
_EMPLOYEE_ANNUALREVIEW_ (owner name first). This join table has two
foreign key columns. One foreign key column refers to table _EMPLOYEE_
and has the same type as the primary key of _EMPLOYEE_. This foreign
key column is named _EMPLOYEE__ <PK of EMPLOYEE>, where <PK of EMPLOYEE>
denotes the name of the primary key column of table _EMPLOYEE_. The
other foreign key column refers to table _ANNUALREVIEW_ and has the same
type as the primary key of _ANNUALREVIEW_. This foreign key column is
named _ANNUALREVIEWS__ <PK of ANNUALREVIEW>, where <PK of ANNUALREVIEW>
denotes the name of the primary key column of table _ANNUALREVIEW_.
There is a unique key constraint on the foreign key that refers to table
_ANNUALREVIEW_.

===== Unidirectional ManyToMany Relationships [[a800]]

The following mapping defaults apply:

* Entity _A_ is mapped to a table named _A_.
* Entity _B_ is mapped to a table named _B_.
* There is a join table that is named _A_B_
(owner name first). This join table has two foreign key columns. One
foreign key column refers to table _A_ and has the same type as the
primary key of table A. The name of this foreign key column is formed as
the concatenation of the following: the name of entity _A_; " ___ ";
the name of the primary key column in table _A_. The other foreign key
column refers to table _B_ and has the same type as the primary key of
table _B_. The name of this foreign key column is formed as the
concatenation of the following: the name of the relationship property or
field of entity _A_; " ___ "; the name of the primary key column in
table _B_.

*Example:*

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Employee {
    private Collection<Patent> patents;

    @ManyToMany
    public Collection<Patent> getPatents() {
        return patents;
    }

    public void setPatents(Collection<Patent> patents) {
        this.patents = patents;
    }

    // ...
}

@Entity
public class Patent {
    //...
}
----

In this example:

* Entity _Employee_ references a collection of Entity _Patent_.
* Entity _Patent_ does not reference Entity _Employee_.
* Entity _Employee_ is the owner of the relationship.

The following mapping defaults apply:

* Entity _Employee_ is mapped to a table named _EMPLOYEE_.
* Entity _Patent_ is mapped to a table named _PATENT_.
* There is a join table that is named
_EMPLOYEE_PATENT_ (owner name first). This join table has two foreign
key columns. One foreign key column refers to table _EMPLOYEE_ and has
the same type as the primary key of _EMPLOYEE_. This foreign key column
is named _EMPLOYEE__ <PK of EMPLOYEE>, where <PK of EMPLOYEE> denotes
the name of the primary key column of table _EMPLOYEE_. The other
foreign key column refers to table _PATENT_ and has the same type as the
primary key of _PATENT_. This foreign key column is named _PATENTS__
<PK of PATENT>, where <PK of PATENT> denotes the name of the primary key
column of table _PATENT_.

=== Inheritance

An entity may inherit from another entity
class. Entities support inheritance, polymorphic associations, and
polymorphic queries.

Both abstract and concrete classes can be
entities. Both abstract and concrete classes can be annotated with the
_Entity_ annotation, mapped as entities, and queried for as entities.

Entities can extend non-entity classes and
non-entity classes can extend entity classes.

These concepts are described further in the
following sections.

==== Abstract Entity Classes

An abstract class can be specified as an
entity. An abstract entity differs from a concrete entity only in that
it cannot be directly instantiated. An abstract entity is mapped as an
entity and can be the target of queries (which will operate over and/or
retrieve instances of its concrete subclasses).

An abstract entity class is annotated with
the _Entity_ annotation or denoted in the XML descriptor as an entity.

The following example shows the use of an
abstract entity class in the entity inheritance hierarchy.

*Example: Abstract class as an Entity*

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Table(name="EMP")
@Inheritance(strategy=JOINED)
public abstract class Employee {
    @Id
    protected Integer empId;

    @Version
    protected Integer version;

    @ManyToOne
    protected Address address;

    // ...
}

@Entity
@Table(name="FT_EMP")
@DiscriminatorValue("FT")
@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name="FT_EMPID")
public class FullTimeEmployee extends Employee {
    // Inherit empId, but mapped in this class to FT_EMP.FT_EMPID
    // Inherit version mapped to EMP.VERSION
    // Inherit address mapped to EMP.ADDRESS fk

    // Defaults to FT_EMP.SALARY
    protected Integer salary;

    // ...
}

@Entity
@Table(name="PT_EMP")
@DiscriminatorValue("PT")
// PK column is PT_EMP.EMPID due to _PrimaryKeyJoinColumn_ default
public class PartTimeEmployee extends Employee {
    protected Float hourlyWage;

    // ...
}
----

==== Mapped Superclasses

An entity may inherit from a superclass that
provides persistent entity state and mapping information, but which is
not itself an entity. Typically, the purpose of such a mapped superclass
is to define state and mapping information that is common to multiple
entity classes.

A mapped superclass, unlike an entity, is not
queryable and must not be passed as an argument to _EntityManager_ or
_Query_ operations. Persistent relationships defined by a mapped
superclass must be unidirectional.

Both abstract and concrete classes may be
specified as mapped superclasses. The _MappedSuperclass_ annotation (or
_mapped-superclass_ XML descriptor element) is used to designate a
mapped superclass.

A class designated as a mapped superclass has
no separate table defined for it. Its mapping information is applied to
the entities that inherit from it.

A class designated as a mapped superclass can
be mapped in the same way as an entity except that the mappings will
apply only to its subclasses since no table exists for the mapped
superclass itself. When applied to the subclasses, the inherited
mappings will apply in the context of the subclass tables. Mapping
information can be overridden in such subclasses by using the
_AttributeOverride_ and _AssociationOverride_ annotations or
corresponding XML elements.

All other entity mapping defaults apply
equally to a class designated as a mapped superclass.

The following example illustrates the
definition of a concrete class as a mapped superclass.

*Example: Concrete class as a mapped superclass*

[source,java]
----
@MappedSuperclass
public class Employee {
    @Id
    protected Integer empId;

    @Version
    protected Integer version;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name="ADDR")
    protected Address address;

    public Integer getEmpId() { ... }

    public void setEmpId(Integer id) { ... }

    public Address getAddress() { ... }

    public void setAddress(Address addr) { ... }
}

// Default table is FTEMPLOYEE table
@Entity
public class FTEmployee extends Employee {
    // Inherited empId field mapped to FTEMPLOYEE.EMPID
    // Inherited version field mapped to FTEMPLOYEE.VERSION
    // Inherited address field mapped to FTEMPLOYEE.ADDR fk

    // Defaults to FTEMPLOYEE.SALARY
    protected Integer salary;

    public FTEmployee() {}

    public Integer getSalary() { ... }

    public void setSalary(Integer salary) { ... }
}

@Entity
@Table(name="PT_EMP")
@AssociationOverride(name="address", joincolumns=@JoinColumn(name="ADDR_ID"))
public class PartTimeEmployee extends Employee {
    // Inherited empId field mapped to PT_EMP.EMPID
    // Inherited version field mapped to PT_EMP.VERSION
    // address field mapping overridden to PT_EMP.ADDR_ID fk
    @Column(name="WAGE")
    protected Float hourlyWage;

    public PartTimeEmployee() {}

    public Float getHourlyWage() { ... }

    public void setHourlyWage(Float wage) { ... }
}
----

==== Non-Entity Classes in the Entity Inheritance Hierarchy

An entity can have a non-entity
superclass, which may be either a concrete or abstract
class.footnote:[The superclass must
not be an embeddable class or id class.]

The non-entity superclass serves for
inheritance of behavior only. The state of a non-entity superclass is
not persistent. Any state inherited from non-entity superclasses is
non-persistent in an inheriting entity class. This non-persistent state
is not managed by the entity managerfootnote:[If a
transaction-scoped persistence context is used, it is not required to be
retained across transactions.]. Any
annotations on such superclasses are ignored.

Non-entity classes cannot be passed as
arguments to methods of the _EntityManager_ or _Query_
interfacesfootnote:[This includes
instances of a non-entity class that extends an entity class.] and cannot bear mapping information.

The following example illustrates the use of
a non-entity class as a superclass of an entity.

*Example: Non-entity superclass*

[source,java]
----
public class Cart {
    protected Integer operationCount; // transient state

    public Cart() {
        operationCount = 0;
    }

    public Integer getOperationCount() {
        return operationCount;
    }

    public void incrementOperationCount() {
        operationCount++;
    }
}

@Entity
public class ShoppingCart extends Cart {
    Collection<Item> items = new Vector<Item>();

    public ShoppingCart() {
        super();
    }

    // ...

    @OneToMany
    public Collection<Item> getItems() {
        return items;
    }

    public void addItem(Item item) {
        items.add(item);
        incrementOperationCount();
    }
}
----

=== Inheritance Mapping Strategies [[a966]]

The mapping of class hierarchies is specified through metadata.

There are three basic strategies that are
used when mapping a class or class hierarchy to a relational database:

* a single table per class hierarchy
* a joined subclass strategy, in which fields
that are specific to a subclass are mapped to a separate table than the
fields that are common to the parent class, and a join is performed to
instantiate the subclass.
* a table per concrete entity class

An implementation is required to support the
single table per class hierarchy inheritance mapping strategy and the
joined subclass strategy.

[NOTE]
====
Support for the table per concrete class
inheritance mapping strategy is optional in this release. Applications
that use this mapping strategy will not be portable.

Support for the combination of inheritance
strategies within a single entity inheritance hierarchy is not required
by this specification.
====

==== Single Table per Class Hierarchy Strategy

In this strategy, all the classes in a
hierarchy are mapped to a single table. The table has a column that
serves as a “discriminator column”, that is, a column whose value
identifies the specific subclass to which the instance that is
represented by the row belongs.

This mapping strategy provides good support
for polymorphic relationships between entities and for queries that
range over the class hierarchy.

It has the drawback, however, that it
requires that the columns that correspond to state specific to the
subclasses be nullable.

==== Joined Subclass Strategy

In the joined subclass strategy, the root of
the class hierarchy is represented by a single table. Each subclass is
represented by a separate table that contains those fields that are
specific to the subclass (not inherited from its superclass), as well as
the column(s) that represent its primary key. The primary key column(s)
of the subclass table serves as a foreign key to the primary key of the
superclass table.

This strategy provides support for
polymorphic relationships between entities.

It has the drawback that it requires that one
or more join operations be performed to instantiate instances of a
subclass. In deep class hierarchies, this may lead to unacceptable
performance. Queries that range over the class hierarchy likewise
require joins.

==== Table per Concrete Class Strategy

In this mapping strategy, each class is
mapped to a separate table. All properties of the class, including
inherited properties, are mapped to columns of the table for the class.

This strategy has the following drawbacks:

* It provides poor support for polymorphic relationships.
* It typically requires that SQL UNION queries
(or a separate SQL query per subclass) be issued for queries that are
intended to range over the class hierarchy.

=== Naming of Database Objects [[a988]]

Many annotations and annotation elements
contain names of database objects or assume default names for database
objects.

This specification requires the following
with regard to the interpretation of the names referencing database
objects. These names include the names of tables, columns, and other
database elements. Such names also include names that result from
defaulting (e.g., a table name that is defaulted from an entity name or
a column name that is defaulted from a field or property name).

By default, the names of database objects
must be treated as undelimited identifiers and passed to the database as
such.

For example, assuming the use of an English
locale, the following must be passed to the database as undelimited
identifers so that they will be treated as equivalent for all databases
that comply with the SQL Standard's requirements for the treatment of
“regular identifiers” (undelimited identifiers) and “delimited
identifiers” <<a19494>>:

[source,java]
----
@Table(name="Customer")
@Table(name="customer")
@Table(name="cUsTomer")
----

Similarly, the following must be treated as equivalent:

[source,java]
----
@JoinColumn(name="CUSTOMER")
@ManyToOne Customer customer;

@JoinColumn(name="customer")
@ManyToOne Customer customer;

@ManyToOne Customer customer;
----

To specify delimited identifiers, one of the
following approaches must be used:

* It is possible to specify that all database
identifiers in use for a persistence unit be treated as delimited
identifiers by specifying the _<delimited-identifiers/>_ element within
the _persistence-unit-defaults_ element of the object/relational xml
mapping file. If the _<delimited-identifiers/>_ element is specified, it
cannot be overridden.
* It is possible to specify on a per-name basis
that a name for a database object is to be interpreted as a delimited
identifier as follows:
** Using annotations, a name is specified as a
delimited identifier by enclosing the name within double quotes, whereby
the inner quotes are escaped, e.g., `@Table(name="\"customer\"")`.
** When using XML, a name is specified as
a delimited identifier by use of double quotes, e.g., `<table name="\&quot;customer\&quot;"/>` footnote:[If
<delimited-identifiers> is specified and individual annotations or XML
elements or attributes use escaped double quotes, the double-quotes
appear in the name of the database identifier.]

The following annotations contain elements
whose values correspond to names of database identifiers and for which
the above rules apply, including when their use is nested within that of
other annotations:

* EntityResult(discriminatorColumn *element*)
* FieldResult(column *element*)
* ColumnResult(name *element*)
* CollectionTable(name, catalog, schema *elements*)
* Column(name, columnDefinition, table *elements*)
* DiscriminatorColumn(name, columnDefinition *elements*)
* ForeignKey(name, foreignKeyDefinition *elements*)
* Index(name, columnList *elements*)
* JoinColumn(name, referencedColumnName, columnDefinition, table *elements*)
* JoinTable(name, catalog, schema *elements*)
* MapKeyColumn(name, columnDefinition, table *elements*)
* MapKeyJoinColumn(name, referencedColumnName, columnDefinition, table *elements*)
* NamedStoredProcedureQuery(procedureName *element*)
* OrderColumn(name, columnDefinition *elements*)
* PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name, referencedColumnName, columnDefinition *elements*)
* SecondaryTable(name, catalog, schema *elements*)
* SequenceGenerator(sequenceName, catalog, schema *elements*)
* StoredProcedureParameter(name *element*)
* Table(name, catalog, schema *elements*)
* TableGenerator(table, catalog, schema, pkColumnName, valueColumnName *elements*)
* UniqueConstraint(name, columnNames *elements*)

The following XML elements and types contain
elements or attributes whose values correspond to names of database
identifiers and for which the above rules apply:

* entity-mappings(schema, catalog *elements*)
* persistence-unit-defaults(schema, catalog *elements*)
* collection-table(name, catalog, schema *attributes*)
* column(name, table, column-definition *attributes*)
* column-result(name *attribute*)
* discriminator-column(name, column-definition *attributes*)
* entity-result(discriminator-column *attribute*)
* field-result(column *attribute*)
* foreign-key(name, foreign-key-definition *attributes*)
* index(name *attribute*, column-list *element*)
* join-column(name, referenced-column-name, column-definition, table *attributes*)
* join-table(name, catalog, schema *attributes*)
* map-key-column(name, column-definition, table *attributes*)
* map-key-join-column(name, referenced-column-name, column-definition, table *attributes*)
* named-stored-procedure-query(procedure-name *attribute*)
* order-column(name, column-definition *attributes*)
* primary-key-join-column(name, referenced-column-name, column-definition *attributes*)
* secondary-table(name, catalog, schema *attributes*)
* sequence-generator(sequence-name, catalog, schema *attributes*)
* stored-procedure-parameter(name *attribute*)
* table(name, catalog, schema *attributes*)
* table-generator(table, catalog, schema, pk-column-name, value-column-name *attributes*)
* unique-constraint(name *attribute*, column-name *element*)

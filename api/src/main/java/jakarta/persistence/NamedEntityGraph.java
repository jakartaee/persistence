 * Declares a named {@linkplain EntityGraph entity graph} or subgraph

 * entity of the graph.
 *
 * <p>The annotations {@link NamedEntityGraphAttributeNode} and
 * {@link NamedEntityGraphSubgraph} control the limits of the graph of
 * associated attributes and entities fetched when an operation which
 * retrieves an instance or instances of the root entity is executed.
 * {@snippet :

 * @Entity
 * public class Employee { ... }

 *
 * <p> A reference to a named entity graph may be obtained by calling
 * {@link EntityManagerFactory#getNamedEntityGraphs(Class)} or
 * {@link EntityManager#getEntityGraph(String)} and may be passed to
 * {@link EntityManager#find(EntityGraph, Object, FindOption...)}.
 * {@snippet :
 * Object employee =

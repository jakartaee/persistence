/**
 * This type represents the root of an entity graph that will be
 * used as a template to define the attribute nodes and boundaries
 * of a graph of entities and entity relationships. The root must
 * be an entity type.
 * <p>
 * The methods to add subgraphs implicitly create the corresponding
 * attribute nodes as well; such attribute nodes should not be
 * redundantly specified.
 * <p>
 * When used to specify fetching, an entity graph has three possible
 * interpretations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>As a <em>load graph</em>, where every node explicitly added
 *     to or explicitly removed from the graph overrides the
 *     {@linkplain FetchType fetching strategy} of the attribute
 *     which was specified via annotations or XML descriptor, but
 *     the graph does not affect the fetching strategy of any
 *     attribute which was neither added to nor removed from the
 *     graph.
 * <li>As a <em>fetch graph</em>, where the graph completely
 *     overrides every fetching strategy specified via annotations
 *     or XML descriptor, and every attribute not explicitly added
 *     to the graph is treated as {@link FetchType#LAZY}.
 * <li>As a <em>refresh graph</em>, where every node explicitly added
 *     to or explicitly removed from the graph overrides the default
 *     behavior of refresh with respect to the corresponding attribute.
 *     The default behavior is to refresh every attribute of an entity
 *     being refreshed, without refreshing any associated entity.
 *     The method {@link #addSubgraph(Attribute)} specifies that an
 *     associated entity <em>should</em> be refreshed. The method
 *     {@link #removeAttributeNode(Attribute)} hints that an attribute
 *     of an entity being refreshed <em>should not</em> be refreshed.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * An entity graph passed as the first argument to
 * {@link EntityManager#find(EntityGraph, Object, FindOption...)}
 * is interpreted as a load graph.
 * <p>
 * When an entity graph is passed to
 * {@link EntityManager#refresh(Object, EntityGraph)}, the graph
 * completely overrides the effect of {@code cascade=REFRESH}, and
 * each node belonging to the graph is treated as an instruction
 * to refresh the corresponding attribute.
 *

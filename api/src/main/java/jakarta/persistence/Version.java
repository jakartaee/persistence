/**
 * Declares the version field or property of an entity class, which
 * is used to detect optimistic lock failures, ensuring the integrity
 * of optimistic transactions. The version field or property holds a
 * version number or timestamp identifying the revision of the entity
 * data held by an entity class instance.
 *
 * <p>An {@linkplain OptimisticLockException optimistic lock failure}
 * occurs when verification of the version or timestamp fails
 * during an attempt to update the entity, that is, if the version
 * or timestamp held in the database changes between reading the
 * state of an entity instance and attempting to update or delete
 * the state of the instance.
 *
 * <p>The version attribute must be of one of the following basic
 * types: {@code int}, {@link Integer}, {@code short}, {@link Short},
 * {@code long}, {@link Long}, {@code java.sql.Timestamp},
 * {@link java.time.Instant}, {@link java.time.LocalDateTime}.
 *
 * <p>This field declares a version number:
 *
 * {@snippet :
 * @Version
 * @Column(name = "REVISION")
 * protected int version;
 * }
 *
 * <p>This field declares a revision timestamp:
 *
 * {@snippet :
 * @Version
 * @Column(name = "LAST_UPDATED")
 * private Instant lastUpdated;
 * }
 *
 * <p>An entity class should have at most one {@code Version} field
 * or property. The version field or property should be declared by
 * the root entity class in an entity class hierarchy, or by one of
 * its mapped superclasses.
 *
 * <p>The {@code Version} field or property should be mapped to the
 * primary table of the entity.

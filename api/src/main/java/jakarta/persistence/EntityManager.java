/**
 * Interface used to interact with the persistence context.
 *
 * <p> An <code>EntityManager</code> instance is associated with 
 * a persistence context. A persistence context is a set of entity 
 * instances in which for any persistent entity identity there is 
 * a unique entity instance. Within the persistence context, the 
 * entity instances and their lifecycle are managed. 
 * The <code>EntityManager</code> API is used 
 * to create and remove persistent entity instances, to find entities 
 * by their primary key, and to query over entities.
 *
 * <p> The set of entities that can be managed by a given 
 * <code>EntityManager</code> instance is defined by a persistence 
 * unit. A persistence unit defines the set of all classes that are 
 * related or grouped by the application, and which must be 
 * colocated in their mapping to a single database.

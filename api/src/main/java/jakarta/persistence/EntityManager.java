/**
 * Interface used to interact with the persistence context.
 *
 * <p>An instance of {@code EntityManager} must be obtained from
 * an {@link EntityManagerFactory}, and is only able to manage
 * persistence of entities belonging to the associated persistence
 * unit.
 *
 * <p>An application-managed {@code EntityManager} may be created
 * via a call to {@link EntityManagerFactory#createEntityManager()}.
 * The {@code EntityManager} must be explicitly closed via a call
 * to {@link #close()}, to allow resources to be cleaned up by the
 * persistence provider. This approach places almost complete
 * responsibility for cleanup and exception management on the client,
 * and is thus considered quite error-prone. It is much safer to use
 * the methods {@link EntityManagerFactory#runInTransaction} and
 * {@link EntityManagerFactory#callInTransaction}.
 * {@snippet :
 * entityManagerFactory.runInTransaction(entityManager -> {
 *     // do work in a persistence context
 *     ...
 * });
 * }
 *
 * <p>In the Jakarta EE environment, a container-managed
 * {@link EntityManager} may be obtained by dependency injection,
 * using {@link PersistenceContext}.
 * {@snippet :
 * // inject the container-managed entity manager
 * @PersistenceContext(unitName="orderMgt")
 * EntityManager entityManager;
 * }
 *
 * <p>If the persistence unit has
 * {@linkplain PersistenceUnitTransactionType#RESOURCE_LOCAL
 * resource local} transaction management, transactions must
 * be managed using the {@link EntityTransaction} obtained by
 * calling {@link EntityHandler#getTransaction getTransaction()}.
 *
 * <p>A complete idiom for custom application management of
 * the {@link EntityManager} and its associated resource-local
 * {@link EntityTransaction} is as follows:
 * {@snippet :
 * EntityManager entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();
 * EntityTransaction transaction = entityManager.getTransaction();
 * try {
 *     transaction.begin();
 *     // do work
 *     ...
 *     transaction.commit();
 * }
 * catch (Exception e) {
 *     if (transaction.isActive()) transaction.rollback();
 *     throw e;
 * }
 * finally {
 *     entityManager.close();
 * }
 * }
 *
 * <p>Each {@code EntityManager} instance is associated with a
 * distinct <em>persistence context</em>. A persistence context
 * is a set of entity instances in which for any given persistent
 * entity identity (defined by an entity type and primary key)
 * there is at most one entity instance. The entity instances
 * associated with a persistence context are considered managed
 * objects, with a well-defined lifecycle under the control of
 * the persistence provider.
 *
 * <p>Any entity instance can be characterized as being in one of
 * the following lifecycle states:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A <em>new</em> entity has no persistent identity, and is
 *     not yet associated with any persistence context.
 * <li>A <em>managed</em> entity is an instance with a persistent
 *     identity that is currently associated with a persistence
 *     context.
 * <li>A <em>detached</em> entity is an instance with a persistent
 *     identity that is not (or no longer) associated with any
 *     active persistence context.
 * <li>A <em>removed</em> entity is an instance with a persistent
 *     identity, and associated with a persistence context, that
 *     is scheduled for removal from the database upon transaction
 *     commit.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The {@code EntityManager} API is used to perform operations
 * that affect the state of the persistence context, or that modify
 * the lifecycle state of individual entity instances. The client
 * may {@linkplain #persist} and {@linkplain #remove} instances,
 * {@linkplain #find(Class, Object) find} entities by their primary
 * key, and execute {@linkplain EntityHandler#createQuery(String)
 * queries} which range over entity types. A given entity may be
 * disassociated from the persistence context by calling
 * {@link #detach}, and a persistence context may be completely
 * cleared, detaching all its entities, by calling {@link #clear()}.
 *
 * <p>The client may also make changes to the state of an entity
 * instance by mutating the entity directly, or it may request
 * that the state of a detached instance be {@linkplain #merge
 * merged}, replacing the state of a managed instance with the
 * same persistent identity. Note that there is no explicit
 * "update" operation; since an entity is a managed object,
 * modifications to its persistent fields and properties are
 * automatically detected, as long as it is associated with an
 * active persistence context.
 *
 * <p>Modifications to the state of entities associated with a
 * persistence context are not immediately synchronized with the
 * database. Synchronization happens during a process called
 * <em>flush</em>. The timing of the flush process depends on the
 * {@linkplain FlushModeType flush mode}, which may be set
 * explicitly by calling {@link #setFlushMode(FlushModeType)}.
 * <ul>
 * <li>For {@link FlushModeType#COMMIT}, the persistence context
 *     is flushed before the transaction commits.
 * <li>For {@link FlushModeType#AUTO}, which is the default, the
 *     persistence context must also be flushed before execution
 *     of any query whose result set would be affected by
 *     unflushed modifications to entities associated with the
 *     persistence context.
 * </ul>
 * The client may force an immediate flush to occur by calling
 * {@link #flush()}.
 *
 * <p>At any given moment, a persistence context might hold an
 * optimistic or pessimistic <em>lock</em> on an entity instance.
 * The full range of possible lock types is enumerated by
 * {@link LockModeType}. Some operations of this interface,
 * including the methods {@link #lock(Object, LockModeType)},
 * {@link #refresh(Object, LockModeType)}, and
 * {@link #find(Class, Object, LockModeType)}, accept an explicit
 * {@link LockModeType}, allowing the client to request a specific
 * type of lock.
 *
 * <p>Interaction of the persistence context (or first-level cache)
 * with the second-level cache, if any, may be controlled by calling
 * {@link EntityHandler#setCacheRetrieveMode(CacheRetrieveMode)} and
 * {@link EntityHandler#setCacheStoreMode(CacheStoreMode)}.
 *
 * <p>Some operations accept one or more built-in and vendor-specific
 * options:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #find(Class, Object, FindOption...)} and 
 *     {@link #find(EntityGraph, Object, FindOption...)} accept
 *     {@link FindOption}s,
 * <li>{@link #refresh(Object, RefreshOption...)} accepts
 *     {@link RefreshOption}s, and
 * <li>{@link #lock(Object, LockModeType, LockOption...)} accepts
 *     {@link LockOption}s.
 * </ul>

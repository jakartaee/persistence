/**
 * Used to override a mapping for an entity relationship.
 *
 * <p>May be applied to an entity that extends a mapped superclass
 * to override a relationship mapping defined by the mapped superclass.
 * If not specified, the association is mapped the same as in the
 * original mapping. When used to override a mapping defined by a
 * mapped superclass, {@code AssociationOverride} is applied to the
 * entity class.
 *
 * <p> May be used to override a relationship mapping from an
 * embeddable within an entity to another entity when the embeddable
 * is on the owning side of the relationship. When used to override a
 * relationship mapping defined by an embeddable class (including an
 * embeddable class embedded within another embeddable class),
 * {@code AssociationOverride} is applied to the field or property
 * containing the embeddable.
 *
 * <p> When {@code AssociationOverride} is used to override a
 * relationship mapping from an embeddable class, the {@link #name}
 * element specifies the referencing relationship field or property
 * within the embeddable class. To override mappings at multiple
 * levels of embedding, a dot ({@code .}) notation syntax must be used
 * in the {@code name} element to indicate an attribute within an
 * embedded attribute. The value of each identifier used with the dot
 * notation is the name of the respective embedded field or property.
 * 
 * <p>When {@code AssociationOverride} is applied to override the
 * mappings of an embeddable class used as a map value, "{@code value.}"
 * must be used to prefix the name of the attribute within the embeddable
 * class that is being overridden in order to specify it as part of the
 * map value.
 *
 * <p>If the relationship mapping is a foreign key mapping, the
 * {@link #joinColumns} element is used. If the relationship mapping
 * uses a join table, the {@link #joinTable} element must be specified
 * to override the mapping of the join table and/or its join columns.
 *
 * <p>Example 1: Overriding the mapping of a relationship defined by a
 * mapped superclass
 * <pre>
 *    &#064;MappedSuperclass
 *    public class Employee {
 *        ...
 *        &#064;ManyToOne
 *        protected Address address;
 *        ...
 *    }
 *    
 *    &#064;Entity 
 *        &#064;AssociationOverride(name="address", 
 *                             joinColumns=&#064;JoinColumn(name="ADDR_ID"))
 *        // address field mapping overridden to ADDR_ID foreign key
 *    public class PartTimeEmployee extends Employee {
 *        ...
 *    }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Example 2: Overriding the mapping for {@code phoneNumbers} defined
 * in the {@code ContactInfo} class
 * <pre>
 *    &#064;Entity
 *    public class Employee {
 *        &#064;Id int id;
 *        &#064;AssociationOverride(
 *          name="phoneNumbers",
 *          joinTable=&#064;JoinTable(
 *             name="EMPPHONES",
 *             joinColumns=&#064;JoinColumn(name="EMP"),
 *             inverseJoinColumns=&#064;JoinColumn(name="PHONE")
 *          )
 *        )
 *        &#064;Embedded ContactInfo contactInfo;
 *       ...
 *    }
 * 
 *    &#064;Embeddable
 *    public class ContactInfo {
 *        &#064;ManyToOne Address address; // Unidirectional
 *        &#064;ManyToMany(targetEntity=PhoneNumber.class) List phoneNumbers;
 *    }
 * 
 *    &#064;Entity
 *    public class PhoneNumber {
 *        &#064;Id int number;
 *        &#064;ManyToMany(mappedBy="contactInfo.phoneNumbers")
 *        Collection&#060;Employee&#062; employees;
 *     }
 * </pre>

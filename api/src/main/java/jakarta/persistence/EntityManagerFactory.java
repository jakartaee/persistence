/**
 * Interface used to interact with the persistence unit, and to
 * create new instances of {@link EntityManager}.
 *
 * <p>A persistence unit defines the set of all classes that are
 * related or grouped by the application, and which must be
 * colocated in their mapping to a single database. If two entity
 * types participate in an association, then they must belong to
 * the same persistence unit.
 *
 * <p>A persistence unit may be defined by a {@code persistence.xml}
 * file, or it may be defined at runtime via the
 * {@link PersistenceConfiguration} API.
 *
 * <p>Every persistence unit has a <em>transaction type</em>,
 * either {@link PersistenceUnitTransactionType#JTA JTA}, or
 * {@link PersistenceUnitTransactionType#RESOURCE_LOCAL RESOURCE_LOCAL}.
 * Resource-local transactions are managed programmatically via the
 * {@link EntityTransaction} interface.
 *
 * <p>An {@link EntityManagerFactory} with a lifecycle managed by
 * the application may be created using the static operations of
 * the {@link Persistence} class:
 * <ul>
 * <li>if the persistence unit is defined in {@code persistence.xml},
 *     an entity manager factory may be created by calling
 *     {@link Persistence#createEntityManagerFactory(String)} or
 *     {@link Persistence#createEntityManagerFactory(String,Map)},
 *     or
 * <li>if the persistence unit was defined using
 *     {@link PersistenceConfiguration}, an entity manager factory
 *     may be created by calling
 *     {@link Persistence#createEntityManagerFactory(PersistenceConfiguration)}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Usually, there is exactly one {@code EntityManagerFactory} for
 * each persistence unit:
 * {@snippet :
 * // create a factory at initialization time
 * static final EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory =
 *         Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("orderMgt");
 * }
 *
 * <p>Alternatively, in the Jakarta EE environment, a
 * container-managed {@code EntityManagerFactory} may be obtained
 * by dependency injection, using {@link PersistenceUnit}.
 * {@snippet :
 * // inject the container-managed factory
 * @PersistenceUnit(unitName="orderMgt")
 * EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory;
 * }
 *
 * <p>An application-managed {@code EntityManager} may be created
 * via a call to {@link #createEntityManager()}. However, this
 * approach places complete responsibility for cleanup and exception
 * management on the client, and is thus considered error-prone. It
 * is much safer to use the methods {@link #runInTransaction} and
 * {@link #callInTransaction} to obtain {@code EntityManager}s.
 * Alternatively, in the Jakarta EE environment, a container-managed
 * {@link EntityManager} may be obtained by dependency injection,
 * using {@link PersistenceContext}, and the application need not
 * interact with the {@code EntityManagerFactory} directly.
 *
 * <p>The {@code EntityManagerFactory} provides access to certain
 * other useful APIs:
 * <ul>
 * <li>an instance of {@link Metamodel} exposing a model of the
 *     managed types associated with the persistence unit may be
 *     obtained by calling {@link #getMetamodel()},
 * <li>an instance of {@link SchemaManager}, allowing programmatic
 *     control over schema generation and validation, may be
 *     obtained by calling {@link #getSchemaManager()},
 * <li>an instance of {@link Cache}, allowing direct programmatic
 *     control over the second-level cache, may be obtained by
 *     calling {@link #getCache()},
 * <li>the {@link CriteriaBuilder}, used to define criteria queries,
 *     may be obtained by calling {@link #getCriteriaBuilder()},
 *     and
 * <li>the {@link PersistenceUnitUtil} may be obtained by calling
 *     {@link #getPersistenceUnitUtil()}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When the application has finished using the entity manager
 * factory, or when the application terminates, the application
 * should {@linkplain #close} the entity manager factory. If
 * necessary, a {@link java.lang.ref.Cleaner} may be used:
 * {@snippet :
 * // factory should be destroyed before program terminates
 * Cleaner.create().register(entityManagerFactory, entityManagerFactory::close);
 * }
 * Once an {@code EntityManagerFactory} has been closed, all its
 * entity managers are considered to be in the closed state.

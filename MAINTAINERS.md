### Jakarta Persistence release steps

* Pick the branch from which you are planing to perform a release.
    - Run the `Build with Parameters` and fill out the form
    - Publishing to Maven Central is automatic, so no extra steps are required at the moment.
    - Once the build is complete, download the generated artifacts (Javadoc/Specification)
        * Jakarta Specifications update. The final step is to update the [specification repository](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications).
        * Create a pull request with the content generated by the specification release and javadocs from the API release (e.g. https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/874)
        * Make sure to update the index file to point to the new versions of downloadable TCK bundles 
        * Optionally, if the XSDs were updated or if it is the first release in the series, create a pull request to update the XSD following the instructions provided at https://jakartaee.github.io/platform/publish-xml-schemas
